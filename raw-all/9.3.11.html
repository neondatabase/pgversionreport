Changes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix infinite loops and buffer-overrun problems in regular
expressions (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Very large character ranges in bracket expressions could cause
infinite loops in some cases, and memory overwrites in other cases.
(CVE-2016-0773)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform an immediate shutdown if the <tt class=
"FILENAME">postmaster.pid</tt> file is removed (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>The postmaster now checks every minute or so that <tt class=
"FILENAME">postmaster.pid</tt> is still there and still contains
its own PID. If not, it performs an immediate shutdown, as though
it had received <span class="SYSTEMITEM">SIGQUIT</span>. The main
motivation for this change is to ensure that failed buildfarm runs
will get cleaned up without manual intervention; but it also serves
to limit the bad effects if a DBA forcibly removes <tt class=
"FILENAME">postmaster.pid</tt> and then starts a new
postmaster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <tt class="LITERAL">SERIALIZABLE</tt> transaction isolation
mode, serialization anomalies could be missed due to race
conditions during insertions (Kevin Grittner, Thomas Munro)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix failure to emit appropriate WAL records when doing
<tt class="LITERAL">ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE</tt> for
unlogged relations (Michael Paquier, Andres Freund)</p>
<p>Even though the relation's data is unlogged, the move must be
logged or the relation will be inaccessible after a standby is
promoted to master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible misinitialization of unlogged relations at the end
of crash recovery (Andres Freund, Michael Paquier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure walsender slots are fully re-initialized when being
re-used (Magnus Hagander)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">ALTER COLUMN TYPE</tt> to reconstruct
inherited check constraints properly (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">REASSIGN OWNED</tt> to change ownership
of composite types properly (Álvaro Herrera)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">REASSIGN OWNED</tt> and <tt class=
"COMMAND">ALTER OWNER</tt> to correctly update granted-permissions
lists when changing owners of data types, foreign data wrappers, or
foreign servers (Bruce Momjian, Álvaro Herrera)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">REASSIGN OWNED</tt> to ignore foreign
user mappings, rather than fail (Álvaro Herrera)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible crash after doing query rewrite for an updatable
view (Stephen Frost)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix planner's handling of <tt class="LITERAL">LATERAL</tt>
references (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>This fixes some corner cases that led to <span class=
"QUOTE">"failed to build any N-way joins"</span> or <span class=
"QUOTE">"could not devise a query plan"</span> planner
failures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add more defenses against bad planner cost estimates for GIN
index scans when the index's internal statistics are very
out-of-date (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make planner cope with hypothetical GIN indexes suggested by an
index advisor plug-in (Julien Rouhaud)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speed up generation of unique table aliases in <tt class=
"COMMAND">EXPLAIN</tt> and rule dumping, and ensure that generated
aliases do not exceed <tt class="LITERAL">NAMEDATALEN</tt> (Tom
Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix dumping of whole-row Vars in <tt class="LITERAL">ROW()</tt>
and <tt class="LITERAL">VALUES()</tt> lists (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible internal overflow in <tt class="TYPE">numeric</tt>
division (Dean Rasheed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix enforcement of restrictions inside parentheses within
regular expression lookahead constraints (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Lookahead constraints aren't allowed to contain backrefs, and
parentheses within them are always considered non-capturing,
according to the manual. However, the code failed to handle these
cases properly inside a parenthesized subexpression, and would give
unexpected results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conversion of regular expressions to indexscan bounds could
produce incorrect bounds from regexps containing lookahead
constraints (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix regular-expression compiler to handle loops of constraint
arcs (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>The code added for CVE-2007-4772 was both incomplete, in that it
didn't handle loops involving more than one state, and incorrect,
in that it could cause assertion failures (though there seem to be
no bad consequences of that in a non-assert build). Multi-state
loops would cause the compiler to run until the query was canceled
or it reached the too-many-states error condition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve memory-usage accounting in regular-expression compiler
(Tom Lane)</p>
<p>This causes the code to emit <span class="QUOTE">"regular
expression is too complex"</span> errors in some cases that
previously used unreasonable amounts of time and memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve performance of regular-expression compiler (Tom
Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <tt class="LITERAL">%h</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">%r</tt>
escapes in <tt class="VARNAME">log_line_prefix</tt> work for
messages emitted due to <tt class="VARNAME">log_connections</tt>
(Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Previously, <tt class="LITERAL">%h</tt>/<tt class=
"LITERAL">%r</tt> started to work just after a new session had
emitted the <span class="QUOTE">"connection received"</span> log
message; now they work for that message too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On Windows, ensure the shared-memory mapping handle gets closed
in child processes that don't need it (Tom Lane, Amit Kapila)</p>
<p>This oversight resulted in failure to recover from crashes
whenever <tt class="VARNAME">logging_collector</tt> is turned
on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible failure to detect socket EOF in non-blocking mode
on Windows (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear whether this problem can happen in
pre-9.5 branches, but if it did, the symptom would be that a
walsender process would wait indefinitely rather than noticing a
loss of connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid leaking a token handle during SSPI authentication
(Christian Ullrich)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span>, ensure that
<span class="APPLICATION">libreadline</span>'s idea of the screen
size is updated when the terminal window size changes (Merlin
Moncure)</p>
<p>Previously, <span class="APPLICATION">libreadline</span> did not
notice if the window was resized during query output, leading to
strange behavior during later input of multiline queries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span>'s <tt class=
"LITERAL">\det</tt> command to interpret its pattern argument the
same way as other <tt class="LITERAL">\d</tt> commands with
potentially schema-qualified patterns do (Reece Hart)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid possible crash in <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span>'s
<tt class="LITERAL">\c</tt> command when previous connection was
via Unix socket and command specifies a new hostname and same
username (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <tt class="LITERAL">pg_ctl start -w</tt>, test child process
status directly rather than relying on heuristics (Tom Lane,
Michael Paquier)</p>
<p>Previously, <span class="APPLICATION">pg_ctl</span> relied on an
assumption that the new postmaster would always create <tt class=
"FILENAME">postmaster.pid</tt> within five seconds. But that can
fail on heavily-loaded systems, causing <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_ctl</span> to report incorrectly that the
postmaster failed to start.</p>
<p>Except on Windows, this change also means that a <tt class=
"LITERAL">pg_ctl start -w</tt> done immediately after another such
command will now reliably fail, whereas previously it would report
success if done within two seconds of the first command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <tt class="LITERAL">pg_ctl start -w</tt>, don't attempt to
use a wildcard listen address to connect to the postmaster (Kondo
Yuta)</p>
<p>On Windows, <span class="APPLICATION">pg_ctl</span> would fail
to detect postmaster startup if <tt class=
"VARNAME">listen_addresses</tt> is set to <tt class=
"LITERAL">0.0.0.0</tt> or <tt class="LITERAL">::</tt>, because it
would try to use that value verbatim as the address to connect to,
which doesn't work. Instead assume that <tt class=
"LITERAL">127.0.0.1</tt> or <tt class="LITERAL">::1</tt>,
respectively, is the right thing to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <span class="APPLICATION">pg_ctl</span> on Windows, check
service status to decide where to send output, rather than checking
if standard output is a terminal (Michael Paquier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> and <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_basebackup</span>, adopt the GNU convention for
handling tar-archive members exceeding 8GB (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>The POSIX standard for <tt class="LITERAL">tar</tt> file format
does not allow archive member files to exceed 8GB, but most modern
implementations of <span class="APPLICATION">tar</span> support an
extension that fixes that. Adopt this extension so that
<span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> with <tt class=
"OPTION">-Ft</tt> no longer fails on tables with more than 8GB of
data, and so that <span class="APPLICATION">pg_basebackup</span>
can handle files larger than 8GB. In addition, fix some portability
issues that could cause failures for members between 4GB and 8GB on
some platforms. Potentially these problems could cause
unrecoverable data loss due to unreadable backup files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix assorted corner-case bugs in <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_dump</span>'s processing of extension member
objects (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make <span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> mark a view's
triggers as needing to be processed after its rule, to prevent
possible failure during parallel <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_restore</span> (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that relation option values are properly quoted in
<span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> (Kouhei Sutou, Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>A reloption value that isn't a simple identifier or number could
lead to dump/reload failures due to syntax errors in CREATE
statements issued by <span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span>. This
is not an issue with any reloption currently supported by core
<span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span>, but extensions could
allow reloptions that cause the problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid repeated password prompts during parallel <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> (Zeus Kronion)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <span class="APPLICATION">pg_upgrade</span>'s file-copying
code to handle errors properly on Windows (Bruce Momjian)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install guards in <span class="APPLICATION">pgbench</span>
against corner-case overflow conditions during evaluation of
script-specified division or modulo operators (Fabien Coelho,
Michael Paquier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix failure to localize messages emitted by <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_receivexlog</span> and <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_recvlogical</span> (Ioseph Kim)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid dump/reload problems when using both <span class=
"APPLICATION">plpython2</span> and <span class=
"APPLICATION">plpython3</span> (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>In principle, both versions of <span class=
"APPLICATION">PL/Python</span> can be used in the same database,
though not in the same session (because the two versions of
<span class="APPLICATION">libpython</span> cannot safely be used
concurrently). However, <span class="APPLICATION">pg_restore</span>
and <span class="APPLICATION">pg_upgrade</span> both do things that
can fall foul of the same-session restriction. Work around that by
changing the timing of the check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <span class="APPLICATION">PL/Python</span> regression tests
to pass with Python 3.5 (Peter Eisentraut)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix premature clearing of <span class=
"APPLICATION">libpq</span>'s input buffer when socket EOF is seen
(Tom Lane)</p>
<p>This mistake caused <span class="APPLICATION">libpq</span> to
sometimes not report the backend's final error message before
reporting <span class="QUOTE">"server closed the connection
unexpectedly"</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent certain <span class="APPLICATION">PL/Java</span>
parameters from being set by non-superusers (Noah Misch)</p>
<p>This change mitigates a <span class="APPLICATION">PL/Java</span>
security bug (CVE-2016-0766), which was fixed in <span class=
"APPLICATION">PL/Java</span> by marking these parameters as
superuser-only. To fix the security hazard for sites that update
<span class="PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> more frequently than
<span class="APPLICATION">PL/Java</span>, make the core code aware
of them also.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve <span class="APPLICATION">libpq</span>'s handling of
out-of-memory situations (Michael Paquier, Amit Kapila, Heikki
Linnakangas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix order of arguments in <span class=
"APPLICATION">ecpg</span>-generated <tt class=
"LITERAL">typedef</tt> statements (Michael Meskes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <tt class="LITERAL">%g</tt> not <tt class="LITERAL">%f</tt>
format in <span class="APPLICATION">ecpg</span>'s <code class=
"FUNCTION">PGTYPESnumeric_from_double()</code> (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <span class="APPLICATION">ecpg</span>-supplied header files
to not contain comments continued from a preprocessor directive
line onto the next line (Michael Meskes)</p>
<p>Such a comment is rejected by <span class=
"APPLICATION">ecpg</span>. It's not yet clear whether <span class=
"APPLICATION">ecpg</span> itself should be changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <code class="FUNCTION">hstore_to_json_loose()</code>'s test
for whether an <tt class="TYPE">hstore</tt> value can be converted
to a JSON number (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Previously this function could be fooled by non-alphanumeric
trailing characters, leading to emitting syntactically-invalid
JSON.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that <tt class="FILENAME">contrib/pgcrypto</tt>'s
<code class="FUNCTION">crypt()</code> function can be interrupted
by query cancel (Andreas Karlsson)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept <span class="APPLICATION">flex</span> versions later than
2.5.x (Tom Lane, Michael Paquier)</p>
<p>Now that flex 2.6.0 has been released, the version checks in our
build scripts needed to be adjusted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve reproducibility of build output by ensuring filenames
are given to the linker in a fixed order (Christoph Berg)</p>
<p>This avoids possible bitwise differences in the produced
executable files from one build to the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Install our <tt class="FILENAME">missing</tt> script where PGXS
builds can find it (Jim Nasby)</p>
<p>This allows sane behavior in a PGXS build done on a machine
where build tools such as <span class="APPLICATION">bison</span>
are missing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that <tt class="FILENAME">dynloader.h</tt> is included in
the installed header files in MSVC builds (Bruce Momjian, Michael
Paquier)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add variant regression test expected-output file to match
behavior of current <span class="APPLICATION">libxml2</span> (Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>The fix for <span class="APPLICATION">libxml2</span>'s
CVE-2015-7499 causes it not to output error context reports in some
cases where it used to do so. This seems to be a bug, but we'll
probably have to live with it for some time, so work around it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update time zone data files to <span class=
"APPLICATION">tzdata</span> release 2016a for DST law changes in
Cayman Islands, Metlakatla, and Trans-Baikal Territory (Zabaykalsky
Krai), plus historical corrections for Pakistan.</p>
