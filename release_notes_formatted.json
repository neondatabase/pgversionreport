A leaky operator therefore can disclose some of the entries in a data column, even if the calling user lacks permission to read that column. In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed to consider the effects of row-level security. A user who has SQL permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows' contents via a leaky operator. This patch further tightens the rules, allowing leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when there is no relevant RLS policy. (CVE-2019-10130)",

ALTER SEQUENCE updates are now fully transactional, implying that the sequence is locked until commit.

To obtain the sequence's other properties, applications must look into pg_sequence. The new system view pg_sequences can also be used for this purpose; it provides column names that are more compatible with existing code.\nAlso, sequences created for SERIAL columns now generate positive 32-bit wide values, whereas previous versions generated 64-bit wide values.

In a database with many triggers this would make a significant speed difference for queries of that form. Since things worked that way before v11, this is a potential performance regression. Users who find this to be a problem can fix it by replacing the view definition (or, perhaps, just deleting and reinstalling the whole information_schema schema).",
