        "Reduce page locking during vacuuming of GIN indexes (Andrey Borodin)",
        "Reduce locking required to change table parameters (Simon Riggs, Fabrízio Mello)\n\nFor example, changing a table's [effective\\_io\\_concurrency](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-IO-CONCURRENCY) setting can now be done with a more lightweight lock.",
        "Improve performance of queries affected by row-level security restrictions (Tom Lane)\n\nThe optimizer now has more knowledge about where it can place RLS filter conditions, allowing better plans to be generated while still enforcing the RLS conditions safely.",
        "Speed up aggregate functions that calculate a running sum using `numeric`\\-type arithmetic, including some variants of `SUM()`, `AVG()`, and `STDDEV()` (Heikki Linnakangas)",
        "Improve performance of character encoding conversions by using radix trees (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Heikki Linnakangas)",
        "Reduce expression evaluation overhead during query execution, as well as plan node calling overhead (Andres Freund)\n\nThis is particularly helpful for queries that process many rows.",

        "Add [SCRAM-SHA-256](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/auth-methods.html#AUTH-PASSWORD \"20.3.2. Password Authentication\") support for password negotiation and storage (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nThis provides better security than the existing `md5` negotiation and storage method.",
        "After creating or unlinking files, perform an fsync on their parent directory (Michael Paquier)\n\nThis reduces the risk of data loss after a power failure.",
        "Reduce configuration changes necessary to perform streaming backup and replication (Magnus Hagander, Dang Minh Huong)\n\nSpecifically, the defaults were changed for [wal\\_level](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL), [max\\_wal\\_senders](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-WAL-SENDERS), [max\\_replication\\_slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-MAX-REPLICATION-SLOTS), and [hot\\_standby](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-HOT-STANDBY) to make them suitable for these usages out-of-the-box.",

        "Improve pg\\_basebackup's handling of which directories to skip (David Steele)",
        "Make `pg_ctl start --wait` detect server-ready by watching `postmaster.pid`, not by attempting connections (Tom Lane)\n\nThe postmaster has been changed to report its ready-for-connections status in `postmaster.pid`, and pg\\_ctl now examines that file to detect whether startup is complete. This is more efficient and reliable than the old method, and it eliminates postmaster log entries about rejected connection attempts during startup.",
        "Reduce pg\\_ctl's reaction time when waiting for postmaster start/stop (Tom Lane)\n\npg\\_ctl now probes ten times per second when waiting for a postmaster state change, rather than once per second.",
        "Change to two-part release version numbering (Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane)\n\nRelease numbers will now have two parts (e.g., `10.1`) rather than three (e.g., `9.6.3`). Major versions will now increase just the first number, and minor releases will increase just the second number. Release branches will be referred to by single numbers (e.g., `10` rather than `9.6`). This change is intended to reduce user confusion about what is a major or minor release of PostgreSQL.",
        "Improve behavior of pgindent (Piotr Stefaniak, Tom Lane)\n\nWe have switched to a new version of pg\\_bsd\\_indent based on recent improvements made by the FreeBSD project. This fixes numerous small bugs that led to odd C code formatting decisions. Most notably, lines within parentheses (such as in a multi-line function call) are now uniformly indented to match the opening paren, even if that would result in code extending past the right margin.",
        "Add slab-like memory allocator for efficient fixed-size allocations (Tomas Vondra)",

        "Improve [cube](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/cube.html \"F.10. cube\")'s handling of zero-dimensional cubes (Tom Lane)\n\nThis also improves handling of `infinite` and `NaN` values.",

      "features": [
        "Move sequences' metadata fields into a new [pg\\_sequence](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/catalog-pg-sequence.html \"51.46. pg_sequence\") system catalog (Peter Eisentraut)\n\nA sequence relation now stores only the fields that can be modified by `nextval()`, that is `last_value`, `log_cnt`, and `is_called`. Other sequence properties, such as the starting value and increment, are kept in a corresponding row of the `pg_sequence` catalog. `ALTER SEQUENCE` updates are now fully transactional, implying that the sequence is locked until commit. The `nextval()` and `setval()` functions remain nontransactional.\n\nThe main incompatibility introduced by this change is that selecting from a sequence relation now returns only the three fields named above. To obtain the sequence's other properties, applications must look into `pg_sequence`. The new system view [pg\\_sequences](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/view-pg-sequences.html \"51.84. pg_sequences\") can also be used for this purpose; it provides column names that are more compatible with existing code.\n\nAlso, sequences created for `SERIAL` columns now generate positive 32-bit wide values, whereas previous versions generated 64-bit wide values. This has no visible effect if the values are only stored in a column.\n\nThe output of psql's `\\d` command for a sequence has been redesigned, too.",
        "Make [pg\\_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-pgbasebackup.html \"pg_basebackup\") stream the WAL needed to restore the backup by default (Magnus Hagander)\n\nThis changes pg\\_basebackup's `-X`/`--wal-method` default to `stream`. An option value `none` has been added to reproduce the old behavior. The pg\\_basebackup option `-x` has been removed (instead, use `-X fetch`).",
        "Add multi-column optimizer statistics to compute the correlation ratio and number of distinct values (Tomas Vondra, David Rowley, Álvaro Herrera)\n\nNew commands are [CREATE STATISTICS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-createstatistics.html \"CREATE STATISTICS\"), [ALTER STATISTICS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-alterstatistics.html \"ALTER STATISTICS\"), and [DROP STATISTICS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-dropstatistics.html \"DROP STATISTICS\"). This feature is helpful in estimating query memory usage and when combining the statistics from individual columns.",
        "Add functions to return the log and WAL directory contents (Dave Page)\n\nThe new functions are [pg\\_ls\\_logdir()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-GENFILE-TABLE \"Table 9.88. Generic File Access Functions\") and [pg\\_ls\\_waldir()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-GENFILE-TABLE \"Table 9.88. Generic File Access Functions\") and can be executed by non-superusers with the proper permissions.",
        "Add operators for multiplication and division of [money](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/datatype-money.html \"8.2. Monetary Types\") values with `int8` values (Peter Eisentraut)\n\nPreviously such cases would result in converting the `int8` values to `float8` and then using the `money`\\-and-`float8` operators. The new behavior avoids possible precision loss. But note that division of `money` by `int8` now truncates the quotient, like other integer-division cases, while the previous behavior would have rounded.",
        "Add function [PQencryptPasswordConn()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/libpq-misc.html#LIBPQ-PQENCRYPTPASSWORDCONN) to allow creation of more types of encrypted passwords on the client side (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nPreviously only `MD5`\\-encrypted passwords could be created using [PQencryptPassword()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/libpq-misc.html#LIBPQ-PQENCRYPTPASSWORD). This new function can also create [SCRAM-SHA-256](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/auth-pg-hba-conf.html \"20.1. The pg_hba.conf File\")\\-encrypted passwords."

        "Rename write-ahead log directory `pg_xlog` to [pg\\_wal](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/wal.html \"Chapter 30. Reliability and the Write-Ahead Log\"), and rename transaction status directory `pg_clog` to `pg_xact` (Michael Paquier)\n\nUsers have occasionally thought that these directories contained only inessential log files, and proceeded to remove write-ahead log files or transaction status files manually, causing irrecoverable data loss. These name changes are intended to discourage such errors in future.",
        "Rename SQL functions, tools, and options that reference “xlog” to “wal” (Robert Haas)\n\nFor example, `pg_switch_xlog()` becomes `pg_switch_wal()`, pg\\_receivexlog becomes pg\\_receivewal, and `--xlogdir` becomes `--waldir`. This is for consistency with the change of the `pg_xlog` directory name; in general, the “xlog” terminology is no longer used in any user-facing places.",
        "Rename WAL\\-related functions and views to use `lsn` instead of `location` (David Rowley)\n\nThere was previously an inconsistent mixture of the two terminologies.",
        "Change the implementation of set-returning functions appearing in a query's `SELECT` list (Andres Freund)\n\nSet-returning functions are now evaluated before evaluation of scalar expressions in the `SELECT` list, much as though they had been placed in a `LATERAL FROM`\\-clause item. This allows saner semantics for cases where multiple set-returning functions are present. If they return different numbers of rows, the shorter results are extended to match the longest result by adding nulls. Previously the results were cycled until they all terminated at the same time, producing a number of rows equal to the least common multiple of the functions' periods. In addition, set-returning functions are now disallowed within `CASE` and `COALESCE` constructs. For more information see [Section 37.4.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/xfunc-sql.html#XFUNC-SQL-FUNCTIONS-RETURNING-SET \"37.4.8. SQL Functions Returning Sets\").",
        "Use standard row constructor syntax in `` UPDATE ... SET (_`columnlist`_) = _`rowconstructor`_ `` (Tom Lane)\n\nThe _`rowconstructor`_ can now begin with the keyword `ROW`; previously that had to be omitted. If just one column name appears in the _`columnlist`_, then the _`rowconstructor`_ now must use the `ROW` keyword, since otherwise it is not a valid row constructor but just a parenthesized expression. Also, an occurrence of `` _`tablename`_.* `` within the _`rowconstructor`_ is now expanded into multiple columns, as occurs in other uses of _`rowconstructor`_s.",
        "When `ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY` marks columns `NOT NULL`, that change now propagates to inheritance child tables as well (Michael Paquier)",
        "Prevent statement-level triggers from firing more than once per statement (Tom Lane)\n\nCases involving writable CTEs updating the same table updated by the containing statement, or by another writable CTE, fired `BEFORE STATEMENT` or `AFTER STATEMENT` triggers more than once. Also, if there were statement-level triggers on a table affected by a foreign key enforcement action (such as `ON DELETE CASCADE`), they could fire more than once per outer SQL statement. This is contrary to the SQL standard, so change it.",
        "Change how logical replication uses [pg\\_hba.conf](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/auth-pg-hba-conf.html \"20.1. The pg_hba.conf File\") (Peter Eisentraut)\n\nIn previous releases, a logical replication connection required the `replication` keyword in the database column. As of this release, logical replication matches a normal entry with a database name or keywords such as `all`. Physical replication continues to use the `replication` keyword. Since built-in logical replication is new in this release, this change only affects users of third-party logical replication plugins.",
        "Make all [pg\\_ctl](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/app-pg-ctl.html \"pg_ctl\") actions wait for completion by default (Peter Eisentraut)\n\nPreviously some pg\\_ctl actions didn't wait for completion, and required the use of `-w` to do so.",
        "Change the default value of the [log\\_directory](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-DIRECTORY) server parameter from `pg_log` to `log` (Andreas Karlsson)",
        "Add configuration option [ssl\\_dh\\_params\\_file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SSL-DH-PARAMS-FILE) to specify file name for custom OpenSSL DH parameters (Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nThis replaces the hardcoded, undocumented file name `dh1024.pem`. Note that `dh1024.pem` is no longer examined by default; you must set this option if you want to use custom DH parameters.",
        "Increase the size of the default DH parameters used for OpenSSL ephemeral DH ciphers to 2048 bits (Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nThe size of the compiled-in DH parameters has been increased from 1024 to 2048 bits, making DH key exchange more resistant to brute-force attacks. However, some old SSL implementations, notably some revisions of Java Runtime Environment version 6, will not accept DH parameters longer than 1024 bits, and hence will not be able to connect over SSL. If it's necessary to support such old clients, you can use custom 1024-bit DH parameters instead of the compiled-in defaults. See [ssl\\_dh\\_params\\_file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SSL-DH-PARAMS-FILE).",
        "Remove the ability to store unencrypted passwords on the server (Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nThe [password\\_encryption](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-PASSWORD-ENCRYPTION) server parameter no longer supports `off` or `plain`. The `UNENCRYPTED` option is no longer supported in `CREATE/ALTER USER ... PASSWORD`. Similarly, the `--unencrypted` option has been removed from createuser. Unencrypted passwords migrated from older versions will be stored encrypted in this release. The default setting for `password_encryption` is still `md5`.",
        "Add [min\\_parallel\\_table\\_scan\\_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-MIN-PARALLEL-TABLE-SCAN-SIZE) and [min\\_parallel\\_index\\_scan\\_size](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-query.html#GUC-MIN-PARALLEL-INDEX-SCAN-SIZE) server parameters to control parallel queries (Amit Kapila, Robert Haas)\n\nThese replace `min_parallel_relation_size`, which was found to be too generic.",
        "Don't downcase unquoted text within [shared\\_preload\\_libraries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SHARED-PRELOAD-LIBRARIES) and related server parameters (QL Zhuo)\n\nThese settings are really lists of file names, but they were previously treated as lists of SQL identifiers, which have different parsing rules.",
        "Remove `sql_inheritance` server parameter (Robert Haas)\n\nChanging this setting from the default value caused queries referencing parent tables to not include child tables. The SQL standard requires them to be included, however, and this has been the default since PostgreSQL 7.1.",
        "Allow multi-dimensional arrays to be passed into PL/Python functions, and returned as nested Python lists (Alexey Grishchenko, Dave Cramer, Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nThis feature requires a backwards-incompatible change to the handling of arrays of composite types in PL/Python. Previously, you could return an array of composite values by writing, e.g., `[[col1, col2], [col1, col2]]`; but now that is interpreted as a two-dimensional array. Composite types in arrays must now be written as Python tuples, not lists, to resolve the ambiguity; that is, write `[(col1, col2), (col1, col2)]` instead.",
        "Remove PL/Tcl's “module” auto-loading facility (Tom Lane)\n\nThis functionality has been replaced by new server parameters [pltcl.start\\_proc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/pltcl-config.html#GUC-PLTCL-START-PROC) and [pltclu.start\\_proc](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/pltcl-config.html#GUC-PLTCLU-START-PROC), which are easier to use and more similar to features available in other PLs.",
        "Remove pg\\_dump/pg\\_dumpall support for dumping from pre-8.0 servers (Tom Lane)\n\nUsers needing to dump from pre-8.0 servers will need to use dump programs from PostgreSQL 9.6 or earlier. The resulting output should still load successfully into newer servers.",
        "Remove support for floating-point timestamps and intervals (Tom Lane)\n\nThis removes configure's `--disable-integer-datetimes` option. Floating-point timestamps have few advantages and have not been the default since PostgreSQL 8.3.",
        "Remove server support for client/server protocol version 1.0 (Tom Lane)\n\nThis protocol hasn't had client support since PostgreSQL 6.3.",
        "Remove `contrib/tsearch2` module (Robert Haas)\n\nThis module provided compatibility with the version of full text search that shipped in pre-8.3 PostgreSQL releases.",
        "Remove createlang and droplang command-line applications (Peter Eisentraut)\n\nThese had been deprecated since PostgreSQL 9.1\\. Instead, use `CREATE EXTENSION` and `DROP EXTENSION` directly.",
        "Remove support for version-0 function calling conventions (Andres Freund)\n\nExtensions providing C-coded functions must now conform to version 1 calling conventions. Version 0 has been deprecated since 2001.",
        "Support parallel B-tree index scans (Rahila Syed, Amit Kapila, Robert Haas, Rafia Sabih)\n\nThis change allows B-tree index pages to be searched by separate parallel workers.",
        "Support parallel bitmap heap scans (Dilip Kumar)\n\nThis allows a single index scan to dispatch parallel workers to process different areas of the heap.",
        "Allow merge joins to be performed in parallel (Dilip Kumar)",
        "Allow non-correlated subqueries to be run in parallel (Amit Kapila)",
        "Increase parallel query usage in procedural language functions (Robert Haas, Rafia Sabih)",

        "Enable parallelism by default by changing the default setting of [max\\_parallel\\_workers\\_per\\_gather](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PARALLEL-WORKERS-PER-GATHER) to `2`.",
        "Add write-ahead logging support to hash indexes (Amit Kapila)\n\nThis makes hash indexes crash-safe and replicatable. The former warning message about their use is removed.",
        "Add SP-GiST index support for `INET` and `CIDR` data types (Emre Hasegeli)",
        "Add option to allow BRIN index summarization to happen more aggressively (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nA new [CREATE INDEX](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-createindex.html \"CREATE INDEX\") option enables auto-summarization of the previous BRIN page range when a new page range is created.",
        "Add functions to remove and re-add BRIN summarization for BRIN index ranges (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nThe new SQL function [brin\\_summarize\\_range()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-INDEX-TABLE \"Table 9.87. Index Maintenance Functions\") updates BRIN index summarization for a specified range and `brin_desummarize_range()` removes it. This is helpful to update summarization of a range that is now smaller due to `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s.",
        "Allow tuning of predicate lock promotion thresholds (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)\n\nLock promotion can now be controlled through two new server parameters, [max\\_pred\\_locks\\_per\\_relation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-RELATION) and [max\\_pred\\_locks\\_per\\_page](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/runtime-config-locks.html#GUC-MAX-PRED-LOCKS-PER-PAGE).",

The new `EXPLAIN` option `SUMMARY` allows explicit control of this.",

        "Allow SSL configuration to be updated during configuration reload (Andreas Karlsson, Tom Lane)\n\nThis allows SSL to be reconfigured without a server restart, by using `pg_ctl reload`, `SELECT pg_reload_conf()`, or sending a `SIGHUP` signal. However, reloading the SSL configuration does not work if the server's SSL key requires a passphrase, as there is no way to re-prompt for the passphrase. The original configuration will apply for the life of the postmaster in that case.",

However, indirect drops (such as a cascade from dropping a key column's data type) had no such check, allowing the deletion of a key column. This resulted in a badly broken partitioned table that could neither be accessed nor dropped.\n\nThis fix adds `pg_depend` entries that enforce that the whole partitioned table, not just the key column, will be dropped if a cascaded drop forces removal of the key column. However, such entries will only be created when a partitioned table is created; so this fix does not remove the risk for pre-existing partitioned tables.

This is unfortunate: it means that the query performance is likely worse than a plain sequential scan would be.\n\nApplications whose performance is adversely impacted by this change have a couple of options. They could switch to a GIN index, which doesn't have this bug, or they could replace `` _`arraycolumn`_ <@ _`constantarray`_ `` with `` _`arraycolumn`_ <@ _`constantarray`_ AND _`arraycolumn`_ && _`constantarray`_ ``.

Some of the risks here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute with empty `search_path` settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.)

Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege. To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the `search_path` used to run an installation script; disable `check_function_bodies` within the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib modules to ensure they are secure. Also provide documentation to help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure.

Its failure to do so meant that rows inserted by prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. In installations that have enabled prepared transactions (`max_prepared_transactions` \\> 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",
        "Avoid incorrect results when `WHERE CURRENT OF` is applied to a cursor whose plan contains a MergeAppend node (Tom Lane)\n\nThis case is unsupported (in general, a cursor using `ORDER BY` is not guaranteed to be simply updatable); but the code previously did not reject it, and could silently give false matches.",

        "Prevent misprocessing of ambiguous `CREATE TABLE LIKE` clauses (Tom Lane)\n\nA `LIKE` clause is re-examined after initial creation of the new table, to handle importation of indexes and such. It was possible for this re-examination to find a different table of the same name, causing unexpected behavior; one example is where the new table is a temporary table of the same name as the `LIKE` target.",
        "Rearrange order of operations in `CREATE TABLE LIKE` so that indexes are cloned before building foreign key constraints (Tom Lane)\n\nThis fixes the case where a self-referential foreign key constraint declared in the outer `CREATE TABLE` depends on an index that's coming from the `LIKE` clause.",

Other segments were simply unlinked, which doesn't authorize the kernel to release the storage so long as any other backends still have the files open.",
        "Fix handling of backslash-escaped multibyte characters in `COPY FROM` (Heikki Linnakangas)\n\nA backslash followed by a multibyte character was not handled correctly.

Continued use of `NOTIFY` then led to queue-fill warnings, and eventually to inability to send any more notifies until the server is restarted.",

Previously, some combinations of inputs followed this rule but others arbitrarily threw an error.",
        "Fix use of uninitialized value while parsing a `*` quantifier in a BRE-mode regular expression (Tom Lane)\n\nThis error could cause the quantifier to act non-greedy, that is behave like a `*?` quantifier would do in full regular expressions.",

        "Prevent possible data loss from incorrect detection of the wraparound point of an SLRU log (Noah Misch)\n\nThe wraparound point typically falls in the middle of a page, which must be rounded off to a page boundary, and that was not done correctly. No issue could arise unless an installation had gotten to within one page of SLRU overflow, which is unlikely in a properly-functioning system. If this did happen, it would manifest in later “apparent wraparound” or “could not access status of transaction” errors.",

        "Ensure detection of deadlocks between hot standby backends and the startup (WAL-application) process (Fujii Masao)\n\nThe startup process did not run the deadlock detection code, so that in situations where the startup process is last to join a circular wait situation, the deadlock might never be recognized.",
        "Ensure that unserviced requests for background workers are cleaned up when the postmaster begins a “smart” or “fast” shutdown sequence (Tom Lane)\n\nPreviously, there was a race condition whereby a child process that had requested a background worker just before shutdown could wait indefinitely, preventing shutdown from completing.",
        "Fix portability problem in parsing of `recovery_target_xid` values (Michael Paquier)\n\nThe target XID is potentially 64 bits wide, but it was parsed with `strtoul()`, causing misbehavior on platforms where `long` is 32 bits (such as Windows).",

        "Fix pg\\_dump to handle `WITH GRANT OPTION` in an extension's initial privileges (Noah Misch)\n\nIf an extension's script creates an object and grants privileges on it with grant option, then later the user revokes such privileges, pg\\_dump would generate incorrect SQL for reproducing the situation.

        "Report the correct database name in connection failure error messages from some client programs (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nIf the database name was defaulted rather than given on the command line, pg\\_dumpall, pgbench, oid2name, and vacuumlo would produce misleading error messages after a connection failure.",

This was particularly a problem with `log_nested_statements` enabled.",
        "In `contrib/postgres_fdw`, avoid leaking open connections to remote servers when a user mapping or foreign server object is dropped (Bharath Rupireddy)\n\nOpen connections that depend on a dropped user mapping or foreign server can no longer be referenced, but formerly they were kept around anyway for the duration of the local session.",
        "In `contrib/pgcrypto`, check for error returns from OpenSSL's EVP functions (Michael Paquier)\n\nWe do not really expect errors here, but this change silences warnings from static analysis tools.",

        "Fix miscalculation of timeouts in `contrib/pg_prewarm` and `contrib/postgres_fdw` (Alexey Kondratov, Tom Lane)\n\nThe main loop in `contrib/pg_prewarm`'s autoprewarm parent process underestimated its desired sleep time by a factor of 1000, causing it to consume much more CPU than intended. When waiting for a result from a remote server, `contrib/postgres_fdw` overestimated the desired timeout by a factor of 1000 (though this error had been mitigated by imposing a clamp to 60 seconds).\n\nBoth of these errors stemmed from incorrectly converting seconds-and-microseconds to milliseconds. Introduce a new API `TimestampDifferenceMilliseconds()` to make it easier to get this right in the future.",
        "Improve configure's heuristics for selecting `PG_SYSROOT` on macOS (Tom Lane)\n\nThe new method is more likely to produce desirable results when Xcode is newer than the underlying operating system.

This could lead to memory overwrites, with ensuing crashes or unwanted data modifications. (CVE-2021-32027)",

That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n\nIn addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism.

        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nIf the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",
        "Fix `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to wait for the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)\n\nRows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for `PREPARE TRANSACTION` commands that were still in progress when `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` checked for them. As before, in installations that have enabled prepared transactions (`max_prepared_transactions` \\> 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",
        "Avoid race condition that can cause backends to fail to add entries for new rows to an index being built concurrently (Noah Misch, Andrey Borodin)\n\nWhile it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially affect any index built or reindexed with the `CONCURRENTLY` option. It is recommended to reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.",
        "Fix `float4` and `float8` hash functions to produce uniform results for NaNs (Tom Lane)\n\nSince PostgreSQL's floating-point types deem all NaNs to be equal, it's important for the hash functions to produce the same hash code for all bit-patterns that are NaNs according to the IEEE 754 standard. This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values. (`'-NaN'::float8` is one way to produce such a value on most machines.) It is advisable to reindex hash indexes on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they might contain such values.",
        "Prevent data loss during crash recovery of `CREATE TABLESPACE`, when `wal_level` \\= `minimal` (Noah Misch)\n\nIf the server crashed between `CREATE TABLESPACE` and the next checkpoint, replay would fully remove the contents of the new tablespace's directory, relying on subsequent WAL replay to restore everything within that directory. This interacts badly with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example is `COPY` into a just-created table). Such optimizations are applied only when `wal_level` is `minimal`, which is not the default in v10 and later.",

        "Don't discard a cast to the same type with unspecified type modifier (Tom Lane)\n\nFor example, if column `f1` is of type `numeric(18,3)`, the parser used to simply discard a cast like `f1::numeric`, on the grounds that it would have no run-time effect. That's true, but the exposed type of the expression should still be considered to be plain `numeric`, not `numeric(18,3)`. This is important for correctly resolving the type of larger constructs, such as recursive `UNION`s.",
        "Disallow creating an ICU collation if the current database's encoding won't support it (Tom Lane)\n\nPreviously this was allowed, but then the collation could not be referenced because of the way collation lookup works; you could not use the collation, nor even drop it.",

We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to.

Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n\nIn cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table.

Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala\\_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan\\_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy\\_River, America/Thunder\\_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of `timestamptz` display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Document how to configure installations and applications to guard against search-path-dependent trojan-horse attacks from other users (Noah Misch)\n\nUsing a `search_path` setting that includes any schemas writable by a hostile user enables that user to capture control of queries and then run arbitrary SQL code with the permissions of the attacked user. While it is possible to write queries that are proof against such hijacking, it is notationally tedious, and it's very easy to overlook holes. Therefore, we now recommend configurations in which no untrusted schemas appear in one's search path. Relevant documentation appears in [Section 5.8.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ddl-schemas.html#DDL-SCHEMAS-PATTERNS \"5.8.6. Usage Patterns\") (for database administrators and users), [Section 33.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/libpq-connect.html \"33.1. Database Connection Control Functions\") (for application authors), [Section 37.15.6](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/extend-extensions.html#EXTEND-EXTENSIONS-SECURITY \"37.15.6. Security Considerations for Extensions\") (for extension authors), and [CREATE FUNCTION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/sql-createfunction.html \"CREATE FUNCTION\") (for authors of `SECURITY DEFINER` functions).

To make them secure whether or not the installation as a whole has been secured, modify them to include only the `pg_catalog` schema in their `search_path` settings. Autovacuum worker processes now do the same, as well.\n\nIn cases where user-provided functions are indirectly executed by these programs — for example, user-provided functions in index expressions — the tighter `search_path` may result in errors, which will need to be corrected by adjusting those user-provided functions to not assume anything about what search path they are invoked under. That has always been good practice, but now it will be necessary for correct behavior. (CVE-2018-1058)"

They were not, leading to a risk of incorrect query optimization. This has been repaired for new installations by correcting the initial catalog data, but existing installations will continue to contain the incorrect markings. Practical use of these functions seems to pose little hazard, but in case of trouble, it can be fixed by manually updating these functions' `pg_proc` entries, for example `ALTER FUNCTION pg_catalog.query_to_xml(text, boolean, boolean, text) VOLATILE`.

This has been observed to result in `reltuples` becoming so much larger than reality as to effectively shut off autovacuuming.

        "Fix failure to reset libpq's state fully between connection attempts (Tom Lane)\n\nAn unprivileged user of `dblink` or `postgres_fdw` could bypass the checks intended to prevent use of server-side credentials, such as a `~/.pgpass` file owned by the operating-system user running the server. Servers allowing peer authentication on local connections are particularly vulnerable. Other attacks such as SQL injection into a `postgres_fdw` session are also possible. Attacking `postgres_fdw` in this way requires the ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection parameters, but any user with access to `dblink` could exploit the problem. In general, an attacker with the ability to select the connection parameters for a libpq\\-using application could cause mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are harder to think of.

A leaky operator therefore can disclose some of the entries in a data column, even if the calling user lacks permission to read that column. In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed to consider the effects of row-level security. A user who has SQL permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows' contents via a leaky operator. This patch further tightens the rules, allowing leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when there is no relevant RLS policy. (CVE-2019-10130)"

That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n\nIn addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism.

        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nIf the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",
        "Fix `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to wait for the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)\n\nRows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for `PREPARE TRANSACTION` commands that were still in progress when `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` checked for them. As before, in installations that have enabled prepared transactions (`max_prepared_transactions` \\> 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",
        "Avoid race condition that can cause backends to fail to add entries for new rows to an index being built concurrently (Noah Misch, Andrey Borodin)\n\nWhile it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially affect any index built or reindexed with the `CONCURRENTLY` option. It is recommended to reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.",
        "Fix `float4` and `float8` hash functions to produce uniform results for NaNs (Tom Lane)\n\nSince PostgreSQL's floating-point types deem all NaNs to be equal, it's important for the hash functions to produce the same hash code for all bit-patterns that are NaNs according to the IEEE 754 standard. This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values. (`'-NaN'::float8` is one way to produce such a value on most machines.) It is advisable to reindex hash indexes on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they might contain such values.",
        "Prevent data loss during crash recovery of `CREATE TABLESPACE`, when `wal_level` \\= `minimal` (Noah Misch)\n\nIf the server crashed between `CREATE TABLESPACE` and the next checkpoint, replay would fully remove the contents of the new tablespace's directory, relying on subsequent WAL replay to restore everything within that directory. This interacts badly with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example is `COPY` into a just-created table). Such optimizations are applied only when `wal_level` is `minimal`, which is not the default in v10 and later.",
        "Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated for a table being attached to or detached from a partitioned table (Amit Langote, Álvaro Herrera)\n\nThis oversight could allow misbehavior of subsequent inserts/updates addressed directly to the partition, but only in currently-existing sessions.",

        "Don't discard a cast to the same type with unspecified type modifier (Tom Lane)\n\nFor example, if column `f1` is of type `numeric(18,3)`, the parser used to simply discard a cast like `f1::numeric`, on the grounds that it would have no run-time effect. That's true, but the exposed type of the expression should still be considered to be plain `numeric`, not `numeric(18,3)`. This is important for correctly resolving the type of larger constructs, such as recursive `UNION`s.",

Fix it so that no error is thrown and instead the back-reference is silently deemed to never match.",
        "Prevent regular expression back-references from sometimes matching when they shouldn't (Tom Lane)\n\nThe regexp engine was careless about clearing match data for capturing parentheses after rejecting a partial match.

        "Avoid using MCV-only statistics to estimate the range of a column (Tom Lane)\n\nThere are corner cases in which `ANALYZE` will build a most-common-values (MCV) list but not a histogram, even though the MCV list does not account for all the observed values. In such cases, keep the planner from using the MCV list alone to estimate the range of column values.",
        "Fix restoration of a Portal's snapshot inside a subtransaction (Bertrand Drouvot)\n\nIf a procedure commits or rolls back a transaction, and then its next significant action is inside a new subtransaction, snapshot management went wrong, leading to a dangling pointer and probable crash.

        "Refuse to rewind a cursor marked `NO SCROLL` if it has been held over from a previous transaction due to the `WITH HOLD` option (Tom Lane)\n\nWe have long forbidden fetching backwards from a `NO SCROLL` cursor, but for historical reasons the prohibition didn't extend to cases in which we rewind the query altogether and then re-fetch forwards. That exception leads to inconsistencies, particularly for held-over cursors which may not have stored all the data necessary to rewind.

        "Ensure that walreceiver processes create all required archive notification files before exiting (Fujii Masao)\n\nIf a walreceiver exited exactly at a WAL segment boundary, it failed to make a notification file for the last-received segment, thus delaying archiving of that segment on the standby.",

        "Stop using query-provided column aliases for the columns of whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane)\n\nThe column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such as `tbl.*` in contexts other than the top level of a `SELECT` list) are now always those of the associated named composite type, if there is one. We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n\nIn cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type `record` to begin with and there's no issue.",
        "Fix incorrect output for types `timestamptz` and `timetz` in `table_to_xmlschema()` and allied functions (Renan Soares Lopes)\n\nThe xmlschema output for these types included a malformed regular expression.",

        "Fix plan generation for index-only scans on indexes with both returnable and non-returnable columns (Tom Lane)\n\nThe previous coding could try to read non-returnable columns in addition to the returnable ones. This was fairly harmless because it didn't actually do anything with the bogus values, but it fell foul of a recently-added error check that rejected such a plan.",
        "Fix query-lifespan memory leak in an IndexScan node that is performing reordering (Aliaksandr Kalenik)",
        "Fix `ALTER FUNCTION` to support changing a function's parallelism property and its `SET`\\-variable list in the same command (Tom Lane)\n\nThe parallelism property change was lost if the same command also updated the function's `SET` clause.",
        "Fix mis-sorting of table rows when `CLUSTER`ing using an index whose leading key is an expression (Peter Geoghegan, Thomas Munro)\n\nThe table would be rebuilt with the correct data, but in an order having little to do with the index order.",
        "Fix risk of deadlock failures while dropping a partitioned index (Jimmy Yih, Gaurab Dey, Tom Lane)\n\nEnsure that the required table and index locks are taken in the standard order (parents before children, tables before indexes). The previous coding for `DROP INDEX` did it differently, and so could deadlock against concurrent queries taking these locks in the standard order.",
        "Fix race condition between `DROP TABLESPACE` and checkpointing (Nathan Bossart)\n\nThe checkpoint forced by `DROP TABLESPACE` could sometimes fail to remove all dead files from the tablespace's directory, leading to a bogus “tablespace is not empty” error.",
        "Fix possible trouble in crash recovery after a `TRUNCATE` command that overlaps a checkpoint (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Heikki Linnakangas, Robert Haas)\n\n`TRUNCATE` must ensure that the table's disk file is truncated before the checkpoint is allowed to complete. Otherwise, replay starting from that checkpoint might find unexpected data in the supposedly-removed pages, possibly causing replay failure.",
        "Fix unsafe toast-data accesses during temporary object cleanup (Andres Freund)\n\nTemporary-object deletion during server process exit could fail with “FATAL: cannot fetch toast data without an active snapshot”.

        "Ensure that logical replication apply workers can be restarted even when we're up against the `max_sync_workers_per_subscription` limit (Amit Kapila)\n\nFaulty coding of the limit check caused a restarted worker to exit immediately, leaving fewer workers than there should be.",

        "Improve logical replication subscriber's error message for an unsupported relation kind (Tom Lane)\n\nv13 and later servers support publishing partitioned tables. Older server versions cannot handle subscribing to such a table, and they gave a very misleading error message: “table XYZ not found on publisher”. Arrange to deliver a more on-point message.",
        "Disallow execution of SPI functions during PL/Perl function compilation (Tom Lane)\n\nPerl can be convinced to execute user-defined code during compilation of a PL/Perl function. However, it's not okay for such code to try to invoke SQL operations via SPI. That results in a crash, and if it didn't crash it would be a security hazard, because we really don't want code execution during function validation. Put in a check to give a friendlier error message instead.",
        "Make libpq accept root-owned SSL private key files (David Steele)\n\nThis change synchronizes libpq's rules for safe ownership and permissions of SSL key files with the rules the server has used since release 9.6\\. Namely, in addition to the current rules, allow the case where the key file is owned by root and has permissions `rw-r-----` or less. This is helpful for system-wide management of key files.",
        "Make pg\\_ctl recheck postmaster aliveness while waiting for stop/restart/promote actions (Tom Lane)\n\npg\\_ctl would verify that the postmaster is alive as a side-effect of sending the stop or promote signal, but then it just naively waited to see the on-disk state change. If the postmaster died uncleanly without having removed its PID file or updated the control file, pg\\_ctl would wait until timeout. Instead make it recheck every so often that the postmaster process is still there.",
        "Fix error handling in pg\\_waldump (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Andres Freund)\n\nWhile trying to read a WAL file to determine the WAL segment size, pg\\_waldump would report an incorrect error for the case of a too-short file. In addition, the file name reported in this and related error messages could be garbage.",
        "Ensure that `contrib/pageinspect` functions cope with all-zero pages (Michael Paquier)\n\nThis is a legitimate edge case, but the module was mostly unprepared for it. Arrange to return nulls, or no rows, as appropriate; that seems more useful than raising an error.",

        "In `contrib/postgres_fdw`, verify that `ORDER BY` clauses are safe to ship before requesting a remotely-ordered query, and include a `USING` clause if necessary (Ronan Dunklau)\n\nThis fix prevents situations where the remote server might sort in a different order than we intend. While sometimes that would be only cosmetic, it could produce thoroughly wrong results if the remote data is used as input for a locally-performed merge join.",

        "Clean up assorted failures under clang's `-fsanitize=undefined` checks (Tom Lane, Andres Freund, Zhihong Yu)\n\nMost of these changes are just for pro-forma compliance with the letter of the C and POSIX standards, and are unlikely to have any effect on production builds.",

        "Do not let extension scripts replace objects not already belonging to the extension (Tom Lane)\n\nThis change prevents extension scripts from doing `CREATE OR REPLACE` if there is an existing object that does not belong to the extension. It also prevents `CREATE IF NOT EXISTS` in the same situation. This prevents a form of trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise future uses of the object by other users. As a side benefit, it also reduces the risk of accidentally replacing objects one did not mean to.\n\nThe PostgreSQL Project thanks Sven Klemm for reporting this problem. (CVE-2022-2625)",
        "Fix permissions checks in `CREATE INDEX` (Nathan Bossart, Noah Misch)\n\nThe fix for CVE-2022-1552 caused `CREATE INDEX` to apply the table owner's permissions while performing lookups of operator classes and other objects, where formerly the calling user's permissions were used. This broke dump/restore scenarios, because pg\\_dump issues `CREATE INDEX` before re-granting permissions."

Prior to this patch, a standby would fail to recover in such a case; however, such directories could be legitimately missing. Create the tablespace (as a plain directory), then check that it has been dropped again once replay reaches a consistent state.",
        "Support “in place” tablespaces (Thomas Munro, Michael Paquier, Álvaro Herrera)\n\nNormally a Postgres tablespace is a symbolic link to a directory on some other filesystem. This change allows it to just be a plain directory. While this has no use for separating tables onto different filesystems, it is a convenient setup for testing. Moreover, it is necessary to support the `CREATE DATABASE` replay fix, which transiently creates a missing tablespace as an “in place” tablespace.",
        "In extended query protocol, force an immediate commit after `CREATE DATABASE` and other commands that can't run in a transaction block (Tom Lane)\n\nIf the client does not send a Sync message immediately after such a command, but instead sends another command, any failure in that command would lead to rolling back the preceding command, typically leaving inconsistent state on-disk (such as a missing or extra database directory). The mechanisms intended to prevent that situation turn out to work for multiple commands in a simple-Query message, but not for a series of extended-protocol messages. To prevent inconsistency without breaking use-cases that work today, force an implicit commit after such commands.",
        "Fix race condition when checking transaction visibility (Simon Riggs)\n\n`TransactionIdIsInProgress` could report `false` before the subject transaction is considered visible, leading to various misbehaviors. The race condition window is normally very narrow, but use of synchronous replication makes it much wider, because the wait for a synchronous replica happens in that window.",

        "Reject `ROW()` expressions and functions in `FROM` that have too many columns (Tom Lane)\n\nCases with more than about 1600 columns are unsupported, and have always failed at execution. However, it emerges that some earlier code could be driven to assertion failures or crashes by queries with more than 32K columns. Add a parse-time check to prevent that.",
        "When decompiling a view or rule, show a `SELECT` output column's `AS \"?column?\"` alias clause if it could be referenced elsewhere (Tom Lane)\n\nPreviously, this auto-generated alias was always hidden; but there are corner cases where doing so results in a non-restorable view or rule definition.",
        "Fix dumping of a view using a function in `FROM` that returns a composite type, when column(s) of the composite type have been dropped since the view was made (Tom Lane)\n\nThis oversight could lead to dump/reload or pg\\_upgrade failures, as the dumped view would have too many column aliases for the function.",

        "Fix control file updates made when a restartpoint is running during promotion of a standby server (Kyotaro Horiguchi)\n\nPreviously, when the restartpoint completed it could incorrectly update the last-checkpoint fields of the control file, potentially leading to PANIC and failure to restart if the server crashes before the next normal checkpoint completes.",
        "Prevent triggering of standby's `wal_receiver_timeout` during logical replication of large transactions (Wang Wei, Amit Kapila)\n\nIf a large transaction on the primary server sends no data to the standby (perhaps because no table it changes is published), it was possible for the standby to timeout.

        "Arrange to clean up after commit-time errors within `SPI_commit()`, rather than expecting callers to do that (Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane)\n\nProper cleanup is complicated and requires use of low-level facilities, so it's not surprising that no known caller got it right. This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued `COMMIT` but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()` as a no-op. All known callers of `SPI_commit()` immediately call `SPI_start_transaction()`, so they will not notice any change. Similar remarks apply to `SPI_rollback()`.\n\nAlso fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all, resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter. This is reported to crash Python 3.11\\. Older Python releases leak some memory but seem okay with it otherwise.",

But we should not have also copied the server's file-ownership check.

As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer.

        "By default, panic instead of retrying after `fsync()` failure, to avoid possible data corruption (Craig Ringer, Thomas Munro)\n\nSome popular operating systems discard kernel data buffers when unable to write them out, reporting this as `fsync()` failure. If we reissue the `fsync()` request it will succeed, but in fact the data has been lost, so continuing risks database corruption. By raising a panic condition instead, we can replay from WAL, which may contain the only remaining copy of the data in such a situation. While this is surely ugly and inefficient, there are few alternatives, and fortunately the case happens very rarely.\n\nA new server parameter [data\\_sync\\_retry](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-error-handling.html#GUC-DATA-SYNC-RETRY) has been added to control this; if you are certain that your kernel does not discard dirty data buffers in such scenarios, you can set `data_sync_retry` to `on` to restore the old behavior.",

That security fix disallowed applying leaky operators to statistics for columns that the current user doesn't have permission to read directly. However, it's somewhat common to grant permissions only on the parent partitioned table and not bother to do so on individual partitions. In such cases, the user can read the column via the parent, so there's no point in this security restriction; it only results in poorer planner estimates than necessary."

In a database with many triggers this would make a significant speed difference for queries of that form. Since things worked that way before v11, this is a potential performance regression.

        "Set a secure `search_path` in logical replication walsenders and apply workers (Noah Misch)\n\nA malicious user of either the publisher or subscriber database could potentially cause execution of arbitrary SQL code by the role running replication, which is often a superuser. Some of the risks here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute with empty `search_path` settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.) Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is a hazard to consider. (CVE-2020-14349)",
        "Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)\n\nAttacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried out against an extension installation script, if the attacker can create objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema of some prerequisite extension. Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege. To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the `search_path` used to run an installation script; disable `check_function_bodies` within the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib modules to ensure they are secure. Also provide documentation to help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure. This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on other extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly. (CVE-2020-14350)"

        "Fix edge cases in partition pruning (Etsuro Fujita, Dmitry Dolgov)\n\nWhen there are multiple partition key columns, generation of pruning tests could misbehave if some columns had no constraining `WHERE` clauses or multiple constraining clauses. This could lead to server crashes, incorrect query results, or assertion failures.",
        "Fix construction of parameterized BitmapAnd and BitmapOr index scans on the inside of partition-wise nestloop joins (Tom Lane)\n\nA plan in which such a scan needed to use a value from the outside of the join would usually crash at execution.",
        "In logical replication walsender, fix failure to send feedback messages after sending a keepalive message (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nThis is a relatively minor problem when using built-in logical replication, because the built-in walreceiver will send a feedback reply (which clears the incorrect state) fairly frequently anyway. But with some other replication systems, such as pglogical, it causes significant performance issues.",
        "Fix firing of column-specific `UPDATE` triggers in logical replication subscribers (Tom Lane)\n\nThe code neglected to account for the possibility of column numbers being different between the publisher and subscriber tables, so that if those were indeed different, wrong decisions might be made about which triggers to fire.",
        "Update oldest xmin and LSN values during `pg_replication_slot_advance()` (Michael Paquier)\n\nThis function previously failed to do that, possibly preventing resource cleanup (such as removal of no-longer-needed WAL segments) after manual advancement of a replication slot.",
        "Fix slow execution of `ts_headline()` (Tom Lane)\n\nThe phrase-search fix added in our previous set of minor releases could cause `ts_headline()` to take unreasonable amounts of time for long documents; to make matters worse, the query was not cancellable within the troublesome loop.",
        "Ensure the `repeat()` function can be interrupted by query cancel (Joe Conway)",
        "Fix `pg_current_logfile()` to not include a carriage return (`\\r`) in its result on Windows (Tom Lane)",
        "Ensure that `pg_read_file()` and related functions read until EOF is reached (Joe Conway)\n\nPreviously, if not given a specific data length to read, these functions would stop at whatever file length was reported by `stat()`. That's unhelpful for pipes and other sorts of virtual files.",
        "Fix mis-handling of `NaN` inputs during parallel aggregation on `numeric`\\-type columns (Tom Lane)\n\nIf some partial aggregation workers found only `NaN`s while others found only non-`NaN`s, the results were combined incorrectly, possibly leading to the wrong overall result (i.e., not `NaN` when it should be).",
        "Reject time-of-day values greater than 24 hours (Tom Lane)\n\nThe intention of the datetime input code is to allow “24:00:00” or equivalently “23:59:60”, but no larger value. However, the range check was miscoded so that it would accept “23:59:60._`nnn`_” with nonzero fractional-second _`nnn`_. In timestamp values this would result in wrapping into the first second of the next day. In `time` and `timetz` values, the stored value would actually be more than 24 hours, causing dump/reload failures and possibly other misbehavior.",

        "Fix timing of constraint revalidation in `ALTER TABLE` (David Rowley)\n\nIf `ALTER TABLE` needs to fully rewrite the table's contents (for example, due to change of a column's data type) and also needs to scan the table to re-validate foreign keys or `CHECK` constraints, it sometimes did things in the wrong order, leading to odd errors such as “could not read block 0 in file \"base/nnnnn/nnnnn\": read only 0 of 8192 bytes”.",
        "Work around incorrect not-null markings for `pg_subscription`.`subslotname` and `pg_subscription_rel`.`srsublsn` (Tom Lane)\n\nThe bootstrap catalog data incorrectly marks these two catalog columns as always non-null. There's no easy way to correct that mistake in existing installations (though v13 and later will have the correct markings). The main place that depends on that marking being correct is JIT-enabled tuple deconstruction, so teach it to explicitly ignore the marking for these two columns. Also adjust some C code that accessed `srsublsn` without checking to see if it's null; a crash from that is improbable but perhaps not impossible.",
        "Cope with `LATERAL` references in restriction clauses attached to an un-flattened sub-`SELECT` in the `FROM` clause (Tom Lane)\n\nThis oversight could result in assertion failures or crashes at query execution.",
        "Avoid believing that a never-analyzed foreign table has zero tuples (Tom Lane)\n\nThis primarily affected the planner's estimate of the number of groups that would be obtained by `GROUP BY`.",
        "Remove bogus warning about “leftover placeholder tuple” in BRIN index de-summarization (Álvaro Herrera)\n\nThe case can occur legitimately after a cancelled vacuum, so warning about it is overly noisy.",
        "Fix selection of tablespaces for “shared fileset” temporary files (Magnus Hagander, Tom Lane)\n\nIf `temp_tablespaces` is empty or explicitly names the database's primary tablespace, such files got placed into the `pg_default` tablespace rather than the database's primary tablespace as expected.",

        "Improve error handling in the server's `buffile` module (Thomas Munro)\n\nFix some cases where I/O errors were indistinguishable from reaching EOF, or were not reported at all. Also add details such as block numbers and byte counts where appropriate.",
        "Fix conflict-checking anomalies in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation mode (Peter Geoghegan)\n\nIf a concurrently-inserted tuple was updated by a different concurrent transaction, and neither tuple version was visible to the current transaction's snapshot, serialization conflict checking could draw the wrong conclusions about whether the tuple was relevant to the results of the current transaction. This could allow a serializable transaction to commit when it should have failed with a serialization error.",
        "Avoid repeated marking of dead btree index entries as dead (Masahiko Sawada)\n\nWhile functionally harmless, this led to useless WAL traffic when checksums are enabled or `wal_log_hints` is on.",

        "Fix failure of some code paths to acquire the correct lock before modifying `pg_control` (Nathan Bossart, Fujii Masao)\n\nThis oversight could allow `pg_control` to be written out with an inconsistent checksum, possibly causing trouble later, including inability to restart the database if it crashed before the next `pg_control` update.",
        "Fix errors in `currtid()` and `currtid2()` (Michael Paquier)\n\nThese functions (which are undocumented and used only by ancient versions of the ODBC driver) contained coding errors that could result in crashes, or in confusing error messages such as “could not open file” when applied to a relation having no storage.",
        "Avoid calling `elog()` or `palloc()` while holding a spinlock (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)\n\nLogic associated with replication slots had several violations of this coding rule. While the odds of trouble are quite low, an error in the called function would lead to a stuck spinlock.",
        "Fix assertion in logical replication subscriber to allow use of `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` (Euler Taveira)\n\nThis was just an incorrect assertion, so it has no impact on standard production builds.",
        "Report out-of-disk-space errors properly in pg\\_dump and pg\\_basebackup (Justin Pryzby, Tom Lane, Álvaro Herrera)\n\nSome code paths could produce silly reports like “could not write file: Success”.",
        "Fix parallel restore of tables having both table-level privileges and per-column privileges (Tom Lane)\n\nThe table-level privilege grants have to be applied first, but a parallel restore did not reliably order them that way; this could lead to “tuple concurrently updated” errors, or to disappearance of some per-column privilege grants. The fix for this is to include dependency links between such entries in the archive file, meaning that a new dump has to be taken with a corrected pg\\_dump to ensure that the problem will not recur.",
        "Ensure that pg\\_upgrade runs with `vacuum_defer_cleanup_age` set to zero in the target cluster (Bruce Momjian)\n\nIf the target cluster's configuration has been modified to set `vacuum_defer_cleanup_age` to a nonzero value, that prevented freezing of the system catalogs from working properly, which caused the upgrade to fail in confusing ways. Ensure that any such setting is overridden for the duration of the upgrade.",
        "Fix pg\\_recvlogical to drain pending messages before exiting (Noah Misch)\n\nWithout this, the replication sender might detect a send failure and exit without making the expected final update to the replication slot's LSN position. That led to re-transmitting data after the next connection. It was also possible to miss error messages sent after the last data that pg\\_recvlogical wants to consume.",
        "Fix pg\\_rewind's handling of just-deleted files in the source data directory (Justin Pryzby, Michael Paquier)\n\nWhen working with an on-line source database, concurrent file deletions are possible, but pg\\_rewind would get confused if deletion happened between seeing a file's directory entry and examining it with `stat()`.",
        "Make pg\\_test\\_fsync use binary I/O mode on Windows (Michael Paquier)\n\nPreviously it wrote the test file in text mode, which is not an accurate reflection of PostgreSQL's actual usage.",
        "Fix `contrib/amcheck` to not complain about deleted index pages that are empty (Alexander Korotkov)\n\nThis state of affairs is normal during WAL replay.",
        "Fix failure to initialize local state correctly in `contrib/dblink` (Joe Conway)\n\nWith the right combination of circumstances, this could lead to `dblink_close()` issuing an unexpected remote `COMMIT`.",
        "Fix `contrib/pgcrypto`'s misuse of `deflate()` (Tom Lane)\n\nThe `pgp_sym_encrypt` functions could produce incorrect compressed data due to mishandling of zlib's API requirements. We have no reports of this error manifesting with stock zlib, but it can be seen when using IBM's zlibNX implementation.",
        "Fix corner case in decompression logic in `contrib/pgcrypto`'s `pgp_sym_decrypt` functions (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Michael Paquier)\n\nA compressed stream can validly end with an empty packet, but the decompressor failed to handle this and would complain about corrupt data.",
        "Use POSIX-standard `strsignal()` in place of the BSD-ish `sys_siglist[]` (Tom Lane)\n\nThis avoids build failures with very recent versions of glibc.",
        "Support building our NLS code with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or later (Juan José Santamaría Flecha, Davinder Singh, Amit Kapila)",
        "Avoid possible failure of our MSVC install script when there is a file named `configure` several levels above the source code tree (Arnold Müller)\n\nThis could confuse some logic that looked for `configure` to identify the top level of the source tree."

In PostgreSQL, the underlying catalog columns are really of type `name`. This change makes `sql_identifier` be a domain over `name`, rather than `varchar` as before. This eliminates a semantic mismatch in comparison and sorting behavior, which can greatly improve the performance of queries on `information_schema` views that restrict an object-name column.

This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued `COMMIT` but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()` as a no-op. All known callers of `SPI_commit()` immediately call `SPI_start_transaction()`, so they will not notice any change. Similar remarks apply to `SPI_rollback()`.\n\nAlso fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all, resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter.

This restriction protects against a known recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers.

(Tom Lane) \n\nAlso, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala\\_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan\\_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy\\_River, America/Thunder\\_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of `timestamptz` display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

Users can work around that by specifying the `--load-via-partition-root` option; but since there is very little chance of success without that, teach pg\\_dump to apply it automatically to such tables.\n\nAlso, fix pg\\_restore to not try to `TRUNCATE` target tables before restoring into them when `--load-via-partition-root` mode is used.

Formerly xsltproc could download those files on-the-fly from sourceforge.net; but sourceforge.net now permits only HTTPS access, and no common version of xsltproc supports that.

Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege.

In cases where these programs need to initiate additional connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were used for the additional connections. This could lead to connection failures if the connection string included any other essential information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters.

Worse, the reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection parameters would have prevented.

That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n\nIn addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism.

        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera) \n\nIf the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",
        "Fix `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to wait for the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin) \n\nRows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for `PREPARE TRANSACTION` commands that were still in progress when `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` checked for them. As before, in installations that have enabled prepared transactions (`max_prepared_transactions` \\> 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",
        "Avoid race condition that can cause backends to fail to add entries for new rows to an index being built concurrently (Noah Misch, Andrey Borodin) \n\nWhile it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially affect any index built or reindexed with the `CONCURRENTLY` option. It is recommended to reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.",
        "Fix `float4` and `float8` hash functions to produce uniform results for NaNs (Tom Lane) \n\nSince PostgreSQL's floating-point types deem all NaNs to be equal, it's important for the hash functions to produce the same hash code for all bit-patterns that are NaNs according to the IEEE 754 standard. This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values. (`'-NaN'::float8` is one way to produce such a value on most machines.) It is advisable to reindex hash indexes on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they might contain such values.",
        "Prevent data loss during crash recovery of `CREATE TABLESPACE`, when `wal_level` \\= `minimal` (Noah Misch) \n\nIf the server crashed between `CREATE TABLESPACE` and the next checkpoint, replay would fully remove the contents of the new tablespace's directory, relying on subsequent WAL replay to restore everything within that directory. This interacts badly with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example is `COPY` into a just-created table). Such optimizations are applied only when `wal_level` is `minimal`, which is not the default in v10 and later.",
        "Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated for a table being attached to or detached from a partitioned table (Amit Langote, Álvaro Herrera) \n\nThis oversight could allow misbehavior of subsequent inserts/updates addressed directly to the partition, but only in currently-existing sessions.",

        "Don't discard a cast to the same type with unspecified type modifier (Tom Lane) \n\nFor example, if column `f1` is of type `numeric(18,3)`, the parser used to simply discard a cast like `f1::numeric`, on the grounds that it would have no run-time effect. That's true, but the exposed type of the expression should still be considered to be plain `numeric`, not `numeric(18,3)`. This is important for correctly resolving the type of larger constructs, such as recursive `UNION`s.",

That exception leads to inconsistencies, particularly for held-over cursors which may not have stored all the data necessary to rewind.

        "Ensure that walreceiver processes create all required archive notification files before exiting (Fujii Masao) \n\nIf a walreceiver exited exactly at a WAL segment boundary, it failed to make a notification file for the last-received segment, thus delaying archiving of that segment on the standby.",

        "Ensure that the correct lock level is used when renaming a table (Nathan Bossart, Álvaro Herrera) \n\nFor historical reasons, `ALTER INDEX ... RENAME` can be applied to any sort of relation. The lock level required to rename an index is lower than that required to rename a table or other kind of relation, but the code got this wrong and would use the weaker lock level whenever the command is spelled `ALTER INDEX`.",

UPDATE` target lists (Tom Lane) \n\nIf the `UPDATE` list contains any multi-column sub-selects (which give rise to junk columns in addition to the results proper), the `UPDATE` path would end up storing tuples that include the values of the extra junk columns. That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n\nIn addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism.

        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera) \n\nIf the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for `PREPARE TRANSACTION` commands that were still in progress when `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` checked for them. As before, in installations that have enabled prepared transactions (`max_prepared_transactions` \\> 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",

This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values. (`'-NaN'::float8` is one way to produce such a value on most machines.) It is advisable to reindex hash indexes on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they might contain such values.",

This interacts badly with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example is `COPY` into a just-created table). Such optimizations are applied only when `wal_level` is `minimal`, which is not the default in v10 and later.",

If any operations had been done on such an index without first upgrading the `ltree` extension to version 1.2, they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes rather than the intended 8\\. This means it is very likely that such indexes are now corrupt. For safety we recommend re-indexing all GiST indexes on `ltree` columns after installing this update.

We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n\nIn cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type `record` to begin with and there's no issue.",

The practical effect of this error is that applications using libpq's async-query API would typically detect connection loss only when `PQconsumeInput()` returns a hard failure. With this fix, a connection loss will normally be reported via an error `PGresult` object, which is a much cleaner behavior for most applications.",

This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued `COMMIT` but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()` as a no-op.

        "Prevent WAL corruption after a standby promotion (Dilip Kumar, Robert Haas) \n\nWhen a PostgreSQL instance performing archive recovery (but not using standby mode) is promoted, and the last WAL segment that it attempted to read ended in a partial record, the instance would write an invalid WAL segment on the new timeline.",
        "Fix mis-ordering of WAL operations in fast insert path for GIN indexes (Matthias van de Meent, Zhang Mingli) \n\nThis mistake is not known to have any negative consequences within core PostgreSQL, but it did cause issues for some extensions.",
        "Fix bugs in logical decoding when replay starts from a point between the beginning of a transaction and the beginning of its subtransaction (Masahiko Sawada, Kuroda Hayato) \n\nThese errors could lead to assertion failures in debug builds, and otherwise to memory leaks.",
        "Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada) \n\nIf decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.",
        "Accept interrupts in more places during logical decoding (Amit Kapila, Masahiko Sawada) \n\nThis ameliorates problems with slow shutdown of replication workers.",
        "Prevent attempts to replicate into a foreign-table partition in replication workers (Shi Yu, Tom Lane) \n\nAlthough partitioned tables can have foreign tables as partitions, replicating into such a partition isn't currently supported. The logical replication worker process would crash if it was attempted. Now, an error is thrown.",
        "Remove pointless check on replica identity setting of partitioned tables (Hou Zhijie) \n\nWhat matters is the replica identity setting of the leaf partitions, so there's no need to throw error if it's not set on the parent.",
        "Avoid crash after function syntax error in replication workers (Maxim Orlov, Anton Melnikov, Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane) \n\nIf a syntax error occurred in a SQL-language or PL/pgSQL-language `CREATE FUNCTION` or `DO` command executed in a logical replication worker, the worker process would crash with a null pointer dereference or assertion failure.",
        "Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL functions (Tom Lane) \n\nIf a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would observe the wrong value. (Within core PostgreSQL, the expanded-datum mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but extensions might use it for other structured types.)",
        "Fix type `circle`'s equality comparator to handle NaNs properly (Ranier Vilela) \n\nIf the left-hand circle had a floating-point NaN for its radius, it would be considered equal to a circle with the same center and any radius.",
        "In Snowball dictionaries, don't try to stem excessively-long words (Olly Betts, Tom Lane) \n\nIf the input word exceeds 1000 bytes, return it as-is after case folding, rather than trying to run it through the Snowball code. This restriction protects against a known recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers. Such a long string is surely not a word in any human language, so it's doubtful that the stemmer would have done anything desirable with it anyway.",
        "Fix use-after-free hazard in string comparisons (Tom Lane) \n\nImproper memory management in the string comparison functions could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers, potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory now. This would only happen with fairly long strings (more than 1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.",
        "Add plan-time check for attempted access to a table that has no table access method (Tom Lane) \n\nThis prevents a crash in some catalog-corruption scenarios, for example use of a view whose `ON SELECT` rule is missing.",
        "Prevent postmaster crash when shared-memory state is corrupted (Tom Lane) \n\nThe postmaster process is supposed to survive and initiate a database restart if shared memory becomes corrupted, but one bit of code was being insufficiently cautious about that.",
        "Add some more defenses against recursion till stack overrun (Richard Guo, Tom Lane) ",
        "Avoid misbehavior when choosing hash table size with very small `work_mem` and large tuples (Zhang Mingli) ",
        "Avoid long-term memory leakage in the autovacuum launcher process (Reid Thompson) \n\nThe lack of field reports suggests that this problem is only latent in pre-v15 branches; but it's not very clear why, so back-patch the fix anyway.",
        "Improve PL/pgSQL's ability to handle parameters declared as `RECORD` (Tom Lane) \n\nBuild a separate function cache entry for each concrete type passed to the `RECORD` parameter during a session, much as we do for polymorphic parameters. This allows some usages to work that previously failed with errors such as “type of parameter does not match that when preparing the plan”.",
        "Add missing guards for `NULL` connection pointer in libpq (Daniele Varrazzo, Tom Lane) \n\nThere's a convention that libpq functions should check for a NULL PGconn argument, and fail gracefully instead of crashing. `PQflush()` and `PQisnonblocking()` didn't get that memo, so fix them.",
        "In ecpg, fix omission of variable storage classes when multiple `varchar` or `bytea` variables are declared in the same declaration (Andrey Sokolov) \n\nFor example, ecpg translated `static varchar str1[10], str2[20], str3[30];` in such a way that only `str1` was marked `static`.",
        "Allow cross-platform tablespace relocation in pg\\_basebackup (Robert Haas) \n\nAllow the remote path in `--tablespace-mapping` to be either a Unix-style or Windows-style absolute path, since the source server could be on a different OS than the local system.",
        "In pg\\_stat\\_statements, fix access to already-freed memory (zhaoqigui) \n\nThis occurred if pg\\_stat\\_statements tracked a `ROLLBACK` command issued via extended query protocol. In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion failure. In production builds there would often be no visible ill effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely result would be to store garbage for the query string.",
        "In postgres\\_fdw, ensure that target lists constructed for EvalPlanQual plans will have all required columns (Richard Guo, Etsuro Fujita) \n\nThis avoids “variable not found in subplan target list” errors in rare cases.",
        "Reject unwanted output from the platform's `uuid_create()` function (Nazir Bilal Yavuz) \n\nThe uuid-ossp module expects libc's `uuid_create()` to produce a version-1 UUID, but recent NetBSD releases produce a version-4 (random) UUID instead. Check for that, and complain if so. Drop the documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable for uuid-ossp. (If a version-4 UUID is okay for your purposes, you don't need uuid-ossp at all; just use `gen_random_uuid()`.)",
        "Include new Perl test modules in standard installations (Álvaro Herrera) \n\nAdd `PostgreSQL/Test/Cluster.pm` and `PostgreSQL/Test/Utils.pm` to the standard installation file set in pre-version-15 branches. This is for the benefit of extensions that want to use newly-written test code in older branches.",
        "On NetBSD, force dynamic symbol resolution at postmaster start (Andres Freund, Tom Lane) \n\nThis avoids a risk of deadlock in the dynamic linker on NetBSD 10.",
        "Fix incompatibilities with LLVM 15 (Thomas Munro, Andres Freund) ",
        "Allow use of `__sync_lock_test_and_set()` for spinlocks on any machine (Tom Lane) \n\nThis eases porting to new machine architectures, at least if you're using a compiler that supports this GCC builtin function.",

        "Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2022f for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Iran, Jordan, Mexico, Palestine, and Syria, plus historical corrections for Chile, Crimea, Iran, and Mexico. (Tom Lane) \n\nAlso, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala\\_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan\\_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy\\_River, America/Thunder\\_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of `timestamptz` display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera) \n\nIf the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

This could result in those indexes becoming corrupt, since they'd still contain references to any heap entries removed by the `VACUUM`; subsequent queries using such indexes would be likely to return rows they shouldn't. This problem does not affect autovacuum, since it doesn't use parallel vacuuming. However, it is advisable to reindex any manually-vacuumed tables that have the right mix of index sizes.",

View columns such as `most_common_vals` might expose security-relevant data. The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated table.\n\nThe PostgreSQL Project thanks Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem. (CVE-2024-4317)\n\nBy itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd database clusters. If you wish to apply this change in an existing cluster, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Find the SQL script `fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql` in the _`share`_ directory of the PostgreSQL installation (typically located someplace like `/usr/share/postgresql/`). Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only v14–v16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.\n2. In _each_ database of the cluster, run the `fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql` script as superuser. In psql this would look like  \n\\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql  \n(adjust the file path as appropriate). Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script version. It will not hurt to run the script more than once.\n3. Do not forget to include the `template0` and `template1` databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later. To fix `template0`, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections. Do that with  \nALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;  \nand then after fixing `template0`, undo it with  \nALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;"

You will need to manually re-establish consistency between the referencing and referenced tables, then re-add the constraint.\n\nThis query can be used to identify broken constraints and construct the commands needed to recreate them:\n\nSELECT conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS \"constrained table\",\n       conname AS constraint,\n       confrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS \"references\",\n       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s DROP CONSTRAINT %I;',\n                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname) AS \"drop\",\n       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s ADD CONSTRAINT %I %s;',\n                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname,\n                         pg_catalog.pg_get_constraintdef(oid)) AS \"add\"\nFROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c\nWHERE contype = 'f' AND conparentid = 0 AND\n   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c2\n    WHERE c2.conparentid = c.oid) <>\n   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_inherits i\n    WHERE (i.inhparent = c.conrelid OR i.inhparent = c.confrelid) AND\n      EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_partitioned_table\n              WHERE partrelid = i.inhparent));\n\nSince it is possible that one or more of the `ADD CONSTRAINT` steps will fail, you should save the query's output in a file and then attempt to perform each step.",

        "Fix default signature length for `gist_ltree_ops` indexes (Tomas Vondra, Alexander Korotkov) \n\nThe default signature length (hash size) for GiST indexes on `ltree` columns was accidentally changed while upgrading that operator class to support operator class parameters. If any operations had been done on such an index without first upgrading the `ltree` extension to version 1.2, they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes rather than the intended 8\\. This means it is very likely that such indexes are now corrupt. For safety we recommend re-indexing all GiST indexes on `ltree` columns after installing this update. (Note that GiST indexes on `ltree[]` columns, that is arrays of `ltree`, are not affected.)",
        "Stop using query-provided column aliases for the columns of whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane) \n\nThe column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such as `tbl.*` in contexts other than the top level of a `SELECT` list) are now always those of the associated named composite type, if there is one. We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n\nIn cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type `record` to begin with and there's no issue.",

It may be only latent in previous branches.",

        "Fix incorrect matching of index expressions and predicates when creating a partitioned index (Richard Guo, Tom Lane) \n\nWhile creating a partitioned index, we try to identify any existing indexes on the partitions that match the partitioned index, so that we can absorb those as child indexes instead of building new ones. Matching of expressions was not done right, so that a usable child index might be ignored, leading to creation of a duplicative index.",

        "Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL functions (Tom Lane) \n\nIf a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would observe the wrong value. (Within core PostgreSQL, the expanded-datum mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but extensions might use it for other structured types.)",

This restriction protects against a known recursion-to-stack-overflow problem in the Turkish stemmer, and it seems like good insurance against any other safety or performance issues that may exist in the Snowball stemmers. Such a long string is surely not a word in any human language, so it's doubtful that the stemmer would have done anything desirable with it anyway.",
        "Fix use-after-free hazard in string comparisons (Tom Lane) \n\nImproper memory management in the string comparison functions could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers, potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory now. This would only happen with fairly long strings (more than 1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.",

        "Improve PL/pgSQL's ability to handle parameters declared as `RECORD` (Tom Lane) \n\nBuild a separate function cache entry for each concrete type passed to the `RECORD` parameter during a session, much as we do for polymorphic parameters. This allows some usages to work that previously failed with errors such as “type of parameter does not match that when preparing the plan”.",

        "Add missing guards for `NULL` connection pointer in libpq (Daniele Varrazzo, Tom Lane) \n\nThere's a convention that libpq functions should check for a NULL PGconn argument, and fail gracefully instead of crashing. `PQflush()` and `PQisnonblocking()` didn't get that memo, so fix them.",
        "In ecpg, fix omission of variable storage classes when multiple `varchar` or `bytea` variables are declared in the same declaration (Andrey Sokolov) \n\nFor example, ecpg translated `static varchar str1[10], str2[20], str3[30];` in such a way that only `str1` was marked `static`.",

Check for that, and complain if so. Drop the documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable for uuid-ossp.

(Tom Lane) \n\nAlso, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala\\_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan\\_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy\\_River, America/Thunder\\_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of `timestamptz` display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length (Andrey Borodin) \n\nThe server would process a cancel request even if its length word was too small. This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer. In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be very close to the end of memory. The more likely outcome was a bogus log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code. Complain about the wrong length, instead.",

        "Fix failure to remove non-first segments of large tables (Tom Lane) \n\nPostgreSQL splits large tables into multiple files (normally with 1GB per file). The logic for dropping a table was broken and would miss removing all but the first such file, in two cases: drops of temporary tables and WAL replay of drops of regular tables. Applications that routinely create multi-gigabyte temporary tables could suffer significant disk space leakage.\n\nOrphaned temporary-table files are removed during postmaster start, so the mere act of updating to 15.1 is sufficient to clear any leaked temporary-table storage. However, if you suffered any database crashes while using 15.0, and there might have been large tables dropped just before such crashes, it's advisable to check the database directories for files named according to the pattern `` _`NNNN`_._`NN`_ ``. If there is no matching file named just `` _`NNNN`_ `` (without the `` ._`NN`_ `` suffix), these files should be removed manually.",

(Tom Lane) \n\nAlso, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala\\_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan\\_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy\\_River, America/Thunder\\_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of `timestamptz` display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Avoid deleting still-needed WAL files during pg\\_rewind (Polina Bungina, Alexander Kukushkin) \n\nPreviously, in unlucky cases, it was possible for pg\\_rewind to remove important WAL files from the rewound demoted primary. In particular this happens if those files have been marked for archival (i.e., their `.ready` files were created) but not yet archived. Then the newly promoted node no longer has such files because of them having been recycled, but likely they are needed for recovery in the demoted node. If pg\\_rewind removes them, recovery is not possible anymore.",

        "libpq can leak memory contents after GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion) \n\nA modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos) transport encryption. libpq will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report. Depending on what the calling application does with the error report, this could result in disclosure of application memory contents. There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading beyond the end of memory. Fix by properly zero-terminating the server message. (CVE-2022-41862)"

        "Allow `REPLICA IDENTITY` to be set on an index that's not (yet) valid (Tom Lane) \n\nWhen pg\\_dump dumps a partitioned index that's marked `REPLICA IDENTITY`, it generates a command sequence that applies `REPLICA IDENTITY` before the partitioned index has been marked valid, causing restore to fail. There seems no very good reason to prohibit doing it in that order, so allow it. The marking will have no effect anyway until the index becomes valid.",
        "Fix handling of `DEFAULT` markers in rules that perform an `INSERT` from a multi-row `VALUES` list (Dean Rasheed) \n\nIn some cases a `DEFAULT` marker would not get replaced with the proper default-value expression, leading to an “unrecognized node type” error.",

        "Fix `jsonb` subscripting to cope with toasted subscript values (Tom Lane, David G. Johnston) \n\nUsing a text value fetched directly from a table as a `jsonb` subscript was likely to fail. Fetches would usually not find any matching element. Assignments could store the value with a garbage key, although keys long enough to cause that problem are probably rare in the field.",
        "Fix edge-case data corruption in parallel hash joins (Dmitry Astapov) \n\nIf the final chunk of a large tuple being written out to a temporary file was exactly 32760 bytes, it would be corrupted due to a fencepost bug. The query would typically fail later with corrupted-data symptoms.",

Most places got this right already, but some recently-written replication logic did not.",
        "Remove arbitrary limit on number of elements in `int2vector` and `oidvector` (Tom Lane) \n\nThe input functions for these types previously rejected more than 100 elements. With the introduction of the logical replication column list feature, it's necessary to accept `int2vector`s having up to 1600 columns, otherwise long column lists cause logical-replication failures.",

        "Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length (Andrey Borodin) \n\nThe server would process a cancel request even if its length word was too small. This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer. In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be very close to the end of memory. The more likely outcome was a bogus log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code. Complain about the wrong length, instead.",

        "Fix possible dangling-pointer access during execution of window function run-condition expressions (David Rowley) \n\nIn practice, because the run-condition optimization is only applied to certain window functions that happen to all return `int8`, this only manifested as a problem on 32-bit builds.",
        "Add recursion and looping defenses in subquery pullup (Tom Lane) \n\nA contrived query can result in deep recursion and unreasonable amounts of time spent trying to flatten subqueries. A proper fix for that seems unduly invasive for a back-patch, but we can at least add stack depth checks and an interrupt check to allow the query to be cancelled.",

        "Limit the amount of cleanup work done by `get_actual_variable_range` (Simon Riggs) \n\nPlanner runs occurring just after deletion of a large number of tuples appearing at the end of an index could expend significant amounts of work setting the “killed” bits for those index entries. Limit the amount of work done in any one query by giving up on this process after examining 100 heap pages. All the cleanup will still happen eventually, but without so large a performance hiccup.",

In version 15 that could lead to an undetected deadlock. In version 14, no deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block interrupts while waiting for network I/O.",
        "Clean up the libpq connection object after a failed replication connection attempt (Andres Freund) \n\nThe previous coding leaked the connection object. In background code paths that's pretty harmless because the calling process will give up and exit.

        "Ignore invalidated logical-replication slots while determining oldest catalog xmin (Sirisha Chamarthi) \n\nA replication slot could prevent cleanup of dead tuples in the system catalogs even after it becomes invalidated due to exceeding `max_slot_wal_keep_size`. Thus, failure of a replication consumer could lead to indefinitely-large catalog bloat.",
        "In logical decoding, notify the remote node when a transaction is detected to have crashed (Hou Zhijie) \n\nAfter a server restart, we'll re-stream the changes for transactions occurring shortly before the restart. Some of these transactions probably never completed; when we realize that one didn't we throw away the relevant decoding state locally, but we neglected to tell the subscriber about it. That led to the subscriber keeping useless streaming files until it's next restarted.",
        "Fix uninitialized-memory usage in logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada) \n\nIn certain cases, resumption of logical decoding could try to re-use XID data that had already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.",

        "Fix pgoutput replication plug-in to not send columns not listed in a table's replication column list (Hou Zhijie) \n\n`UPDATE` and `DELETE` events did not pay attention to the configured column list, thus sending more data than expected. This did not cause a problem when the receiver is our built-in logical replication code, but it might confuse other receivers, and in any case it wasted network bandwidth.",

        "Advance a heap page's LSN when setting its all-visible bit during WAL replay (Jeff Davis) \n\nFailure to do this left the page possibly different on standby servers than the primary, and violated some other expectations about when the LSN changes. This seems only a theoretical hazard so far as PostgreSQL itself is concerned, but it could upset third-party tools.",
        "Fix `int64_div_fast_to_numeric()` to work for a wider range of inputs (Dean Rasheed) \n\nThis function misbehaved with some values of its second argument. No such usages exist in core PostgreSQL, but it's clearly a hazard for external modules, so repair.",
        "Fix latent buffer-overrun problem in `WaitEventSet` logic (Thomas Munro) \n\nThe `epoll`\\-based and `kqueue`\\-based implementations could ask the kernel for too many events if the size of their internal buffer was different from the size of the caller's output buffer. That case is not known to occur in released PostgreSQL versions, but this error is a hazard for external modules and future bug fixes.",
        "Avoid nominally-undefined behavior when accessing shared memory in 32-bit builds (Andres Freund) \n\nclang's undefined-behavior sanitizer complained about use of a pointer that was less aligned than it should be. It's very unlikely that this would cause a problem in non-debug builds, but it's worth fixing for testing purposes.",

Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version.

In _each_ database of the cluster, run the `fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql` script as superuser. In psql this would look like  \n\\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql  \n(adjust the file path as appropriate). Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script version. It will not hurt to run the script more than once.\n3. Do not forget to include the `template0` and `template1` databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later. To fix `template0`, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.

In particular, after `DETACH` the now stand-alone table would be missing foreign-key enforcement triggers, which could result in the table later containing rows that fail the foreign-key constraint. A subsequent re-`ATTACH` could fail with surprising errors, too.\n\nThe way to fix this is to do `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` on the now stand-alone table for each faulty constraint, and then re-add the constraint.

        "Fix detection of skewed data during parallel hash join (Thomas Munro) \n\nAfter repartitioning the inner side of a hash join because one partition has accumulated too many tuples, we check to see if all the partition's tuples went into the same child partition, which suggests that they all have the same hash value and further repartitioning cannot improve matters. This check malfunctioned in some cases, allowing repeated futile repartitioning which would eventually end in a resource-exhaustion error.",

        "Fix race condition in `COMMIT PREPARED` that resulted in orphaned 2PC files (wuchengwen) \n\nA concurrent `PREPARE TRANSACTION` could cause `COMMIT PREPARED` to not remove the on-disk two-phase state file for the completed transaction. There was no immediate ill effect, but a subsequent crash-and-recovery could fail with “could not access status of transaction”, requiring manual removal of the orphaned file to restore service.",

        "Fix ways in which an “in place” catalog update could be lost (Noah Misch) \n\nNormal row updates write a new version of the row to preserve rollback-ability of the transaction. However, certain system catalog updates are intentionally non-transactional and are done with an in-place update of the row. These patches fix race conditions that could cause the effects of an in-place update to be lost. As an example, it was possible to forget having set `pg_class`.`relhasindex` to true, preventing updates of the new index and thus causing index corruption.",

If it did occur it would result in an indefinite wait.",

        "Do not ignore a concurrent `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` that is working on an index with predicates or expressions (Michail Nikolaev) \n\nNormally, `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` does not need to wait for other `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` operations on other tables. However, this optimization is not applied if the other `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is processing an index with predicates or expressions, on the chance that such expressions contain user-defined code that accesses other tables. Careless coding created a race condition such that that rule was not applied uniformly, possibly allowing inconsistent behavior.",
        "Fix “failed to find plan for subquery/CTE” errors in `EXPLAIN` (Richard Guo, Tom Lane) \n\nThis case arose while trying to print references to fields of a RECORD-type output of a subquery when the subquery has been optimized out of the plan altogether (which is possible at least in the case that it has a constant-false `WHERE` condition). Nothing remains in the plan to identify the original field names, so fall back to printing `` f_`N`_ `` for the _`N`_'th record column. (That's actually the right thing anyway, if the record output arose from a `ROW()` constructor.)",

Avoid the problem by defining the view to exclude incompletely-set-up cursors.",
        "Prevent mis-encoding of “trailing junk after numeric literal” error messages (Karina Litskevich) \n\nWe do not allow identifiers to appear immediately following numeric literals (there must be some whitespace between). If a multibyte character immediately followed a numeric literal, the syntax error message about it included only the first byte of that character, causing bad-encoding problems both in the report to the client and in the postmaster log file.",

        "Fix pg\\_dump's handling of identity sequences that have persistence different from their owning table's persistence (Tom Lane) \n\nSince v15, it's been possible to set an identity sequence to be LOGGED when its owning table is UNLOGGED or vice versa. However, pg\\_dump's method for recreating that situation failed in binary-upgrade mode, causing pg\\_upgrade to fail when such sequences are present. Fix by introducing a new option for `ADD/ALTER COLUMN GENERATED AS IDENTITY` to allow the sequence's persistence to be set correctly at creation. Note that this means a dump from a database containing such a sequence will only load into a server of this minor version or newer.",

Those changes were originally not back-patched out of caution, but they have been in use in later branches for long enough to deem them safe.",
        "Avoid trying to reindex temporary tables and indexes in vacuumdb and in parallel reindexdb (VaibhaveS, Michael Paquier, Fujii Masao, Nathan Bossart) \n\nReindexing other sessions' temporary tables cannot work, but the check to skip them was missing in some code paths, leading to unwanted failures.",

        "Fix incorrect LLVM-generated code on ARM64 platforms (Thomas Munro, Anthonin Bonnefoy) \n\nWhen using JIT compilation on ARM platforms, the generated code could not support relocation distances exceeding 32 bits, allowing unlucky placement of generated code to cause server crashes on large-memory systems.",
        "Fix a few places that assumed that process start time (represented as a `time_t`) will fit into a `long` value (Max Johnson, Nathan Bossart) \n\nOn platforms where `long` is 32 bits (notably Windows), this coding would fail after Y2038\\.

        "Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2024b (Tom Lane) \n\nThis tzdata release changes the old System-V-compatibility zone names to duplicate the corresponding geographic zones; for example `PST8PDT` is now an alias for `America/Los_Angeles`. The main visible consequence is that for timestamps before the introduction of standardized time zones, the zone is considered to represent local mean solar time for the named location. For example, in `PST8PDT`, `timestamptz` input such as `1801-01-01 00:00` would previously have been rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-08`, but now it is rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-07:52:58`.\n\nAlso, historical corrections for Mexico, Mongolia, and Portugal. Notably, `Asia/Choibalsan` is now an alias for `Asia/Ulaanbaatar` rather than being a separate zone, mainly because the differences between those zones were found to be based on untrustworthy data."

Also, finite-but-very-large values (near the endpoints of the representable timestamp range) could result in internal overflows, again causing poor decisions.

(CVE-2024-4317)\n\nBy itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd database clusters. If you wish to apply this change in an existing cluster, you will need to do the following:\n\n1. Find the SQL script `fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql` in the _`share`_ directory of the PostgreSQL installation (typically located someplace like `/usr/share/postgresql/`). Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only v14–v16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.\n2. In _each_ database of the cluster, run the `fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql` script as superuser. In psql this would look like  \n\\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql  \n(adjust the file path as appropriate). Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script version. It will not hurt to run the script more than once.\n3. Do not forget to include the `template0` and `template1` databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later. To fix `template0`, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections.

The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will execute malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server parameter `restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind` that can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and teach pg\\_dump to set it when available.

In particular, after `DETACH` the now stand-alone table would be missing foreign-key enforcement triggers, which could result in the table later containing rows that fail the foreign-key constraint. A subsequent re-`ATTACH` could fail with surprising errors, too.\n\nThe way to fix this is to do `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` on the now stand-alone table for each faulty constraint, and then re-add the constraint.

In recent PostgreSQL releases, an abort in the Windows runtime library could occur because of confusion about that.\n\nAnyone who encounters the new error message should either create a new duplicated locale with an ASCII-only name using Windows Locale Builder, or consider using BCP 47-compliant locale names like `tr-TR`.",

There was no immediate ill effect, but a subsequent crash-and-recovery could fail with “could not access status of transaction”, requiring manual removal of the orphaned file to restore service.",

        "Fix ways in which an “in place” catalog update could be lost (Noah Misch) \n\nNormal row updates write a new version of the row to preserve rollback-ability of the transaction. However, certain system catalog updates are intentionally non-transactional and are done with an in-place update of the row. These patches fix race conditions that could cause the effects of an in-place update to be lost. As an example, it was possible to forget having set `pg_class`.`relhasindex` to true, preventing updates of the new index and thus causing index corruption.",

However, this optimization is not applied if the other `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is processing an index with predicates or expressions, on the chance that such expressions contain user-defined code that accesses other tables. Careless coding created a race condition such that that rule was not applied uniformly, possibly allowing inconsistent behavior.",
        "Fix mis-deparsing of `ORDER BY` lists when there is a name conflict (Tom Lane) \n\nIf an `ORDER BY` item in `SELECT` is a bare identifier, the parser first seeks it as an output column name of the `SELECT`, for SQL92 compatibility. However, ruleutils.c expects the SQL99 interpretation where such a name is an input column name. So it was possible to produce an incorrect display of a view in the (rather ill-advised) case where some other column is renamed in the `SELECT` output list to match an input column used in `ORDER BY`. Fix by table-qualifying such names in the dumped view text.",
        "Fix “failed to find plan for subquery/CTE” errors in `EXPLAIN` (Richard Guo, Tom Lane) \n\nThis case arose while trying to print references to fields of a RECORD-type output of a subquery when the subquery has been optimized out of the plan altogether (which is possible at least in the case that it has a constant-false `WHERE` condition). Nothing remains in the plan to identify the original field names, so fall back to printing `` f_`N`_ `` for the _`N`_'th record column.

However, pg\\_dump's method for recreating that situation failed in binary-upgrade mode, causing pg\\_upgrade to fail when such sequences are present.

        "Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2024b (Tom Lane) \n\nThis tzdata release changes the old System-V-compatibility zone names to duplicate the corresponding geographic zones; for example `PST8PDT` is now an alias for `America/Los_Angeles`. The main visible consequence is that for timestamps before the introduction of standardized time zones, the zone is considered to represent local mean solar time for the named location. For example, in `PST8PDT`, `timestamptz` input such as `1801-01-01 00:00` would previously have been rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-08`, but now it is rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-07:52:58`.\n\nAlso, historical corrections for Mexico, Mongolia, and Portugal. Notably, `Asia/Choibalsan` is now an alias for `Asia/Ulaanbaatar` rather than being a separate zone, mainly because the differences between those zones were found to be based on untrustworthy data."

Notably, rolling back a transaction that had done `SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` would revert `ROLE` to `NONE` even if that had not been the previous state, so that the effective user ID might now be different from what it had been before the transaction. Transiently setting `session_authorization` in a function `SET` clause had a similar effect.

        "Fix updates of catalog state for foreign-key constraints when attaching or detaching table partitions (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais, Tender Wang, Álvaro Herrera) \n\nIf the referenced table is partitioned, then different catalog entries are needed for a referencing table that is stand-alone versus one that is a partition. `ATTACH/DETACH PARTITION` commands failed to perform this conversion correctly. In particular, after `DETACH` the now stand-alone table would be missing foreign-key enforcement triggers, which could result in the table later containing rows that fail the foreign-key constraint. A subsequent re-`ATTACH` could fail with surprising errors, too.\n\nThe way to fix this is to do `ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT` on the now stand-alone table for each faulty constraint, and then re-add the constraint. If re-adding the constraint fails, then some erroneous data has crept in. You will need to manually re-establish consistency between the referencing and referenced tables, then re-add the constraint.\n\nThis query can be used to identify broken constraints and construct the commands needed to recreate them:\n\nSELECT conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS \"constrained table\",\n       conname AS constraint,\n       confrelid::pg_catalog.regclass AS \"references\",\n       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s DROP CONSTRAINT %I;',\n                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname) AS \"drop\",\n       pg_catalog.format('ALTER TABLE %s ADD CONSTRAINT %I %s;',\n                         conrelid::pg_catalog.regclass, conname,\n                         pg_catalog.pg_get_constraintdef(oid)) AS \"add\"\nFROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c\nWHERE contype = 'f' AND conparentid = 0 AND\n   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c2\n    WHERE c2.conparentid = c.oid) <>\n   (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_inherits i\n    WHERE (i.inhparent = c.conrelid OR i.inhparent = c.confrelid) AND\n      EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_catalog.pg_partitioned_table\n              WHERE partrelid = i.inhparent));\n\nSince it is possible that one or more of the `ADD CONSTRAINT` steps will fail, you should save the query's output in a file and then attempt to perform each step.",
        "Fix test for `C` locale when `LC_COLLATE` is different from `LC_CTYPE` (Jeff Davis) \n\nWhen using `libc` as the default collation provider, the test to see if `C` locale is in use for collation accidentally checked `LC_CTYPE` not `LC_COLLATE`. This has no impact in the typical case where those settings are the same, nor if both are not `C` (nor its alias `POSIX`). However, if `LC_CTYPE` is `C` while `LC_COLLATE` is some other locale, wrong query answers could ensue, and corruption of indexes on strings was possible. Users of databases with such settings should reindex affected indexes after installing this update. The converse case with `LC_COLLATE` being `C` while `LC_CTYPE` is some other locale would cause performance degradation, but no actual errors.",

However, certain system catalog updates are intentionally non-transactional and are done with an in-place update of the row. These patches fix race conditions that could cause the effects of an in-place update to be lost.

The main visible consequence is that for timestamps before the introduction of standardized time zones, the zone is considered to represent local mean solar time for the named location. For example, in `PST8PDT`, `timestamptz` input such as `1801-01-01 00:00` would previously have been rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-08`, but now it is rendered as `1801-01-01 00:00:00-07:52:58`.\n\nAlso, historical corrections for Mexico, Mongolia, and Portugal.
