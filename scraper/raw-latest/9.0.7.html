    Changes</a></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Require execute permission on the trigger function for
        <tt class="COMMAND">CREATE TRIGGER</tt> (Robert Haas)</p>

        <p>This missing check could allow another user to execute a
        trigger function with forged input data, by installing it
        on a table he owns. This is only of significance for
        trigger functions marked <tt class="LITERAL">SECURITY
        DEFINER</tt>, since otherwise trigger functions run as the
        table owner anyway. (CVE-2012-0866)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Remove arbitrary limitation on length of common name in
        SSL certificates (Heikki Linnakangas)</p>

        <p>Both <span class="APPLICATION">libpq</span> and the
        server truncated the common name extracted from an SSL
        certificate at 32 bytes. Normally this would cause nothing
        worse than an unexpected verification failure, but there
        are some rather-implausible scenarios in which it might
        allow one certificate holder to impersonate another. The
        victim would have to have a common name exactly 32 bytes
        long, and the attacker would have to persuade a trusted CA
        to issue a certificate in which the common name has that
        string as a prefix. Impersonating a server would also
        require some additional exploit to redirect client
        connections. (CVE-2012-0867)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Convert newlines to spaces in names written in
        <span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> comments (Robert
        Haas)</p>

        <p><span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> was incautious
        about sanitizing object names that are emitted within SQL
        comments in its output script. A name containing a newline
        would at least render the script syntactically incorrect.
        Maliciously crafted object names could present a SQL
        injection risk when the script is reloaded.
        (CVE-2012-0868)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix btree index corruption from insertions concurrent
        with vacuuming (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>An index page split caused by an insertion could
        sometimes cause a concurrently-running <tt class=
        "COMMAND">VACUUM</tt> to miss removing index entries that
        it should remove. After the corresponding table rows are
        removed, the dangling index entries would cause errors
        (such as <span class="QUOTE">"could not read block N in
        file ..."</span>) or worse, silently wrong query results
        after unrelated rows are re-inserted at the now-free table
        locations. This bug has been present since release 8.2, but
        occurs so infrequently that it was not diagnosed until now.
        If you have reason to suspect that it has happened in your
        database, reindexing the affected index will fix
        things.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix transient zeroing of shared buffers during WAL
        replay (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>The replay logic would sometimes zero and refill a
        shared buffer, so that the contents were transiently
        invalid. In hot standby mode this can result in a query
        that's executing in parallel seeing garbage data. Various
        symptoms could result from that, but the most common one
        seems to be <span class="QUOTE">"invalid memory alloc
        request size"</span>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix postmaster to attempt restart after a hot-standby
        crash (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>A logic error caused the postmaster to terminate, rather
        than attempt to restart the cluster, if any backend process
        crashed while operating in hot standby mode.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">CLUSTER</tt>/<tt class=
        "COMMAND">VACUUM FULL</tt> handling of toast values owned
        by recently-updated rows (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>This oversight could lead to <span class=
        "QUOTE">"duplicate key value violates unique
        constraint"</span> errors being reported against the toast
        table's index during one of these commands.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Update per-column permissions, not only per-table
        permissions, when changing table owner (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Failure to do this meant that any previously granted
        column permissions were still shown as having been granted
        by the old owner. This meant that neither the new owner nor
        a superuser could revoke the now-untraceable-to-table-owner
        permissions.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Support foreign data wrappers and foreign servers in
        <tt class="COMMAND">REASSIGN OWNED</tt> (Alvaro
        Herrera)</p>

        <p>This command failed with <span class="QUOTE">"unexpected
        classid"</span> errors if it needed to change the ownership
        of any such objects.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Allow non-existent values for some settings in
        <tt class="COMMAND">ALTER USER/DATABASE SET</tt> (Heikki
        Linnakangas)</p>

        <p>Allow <tt class=
        "VARNAME">default_text_search_config</tt>, <tt class=
        "VARNAME">default_tablespace</tt>, and <tt class=
        "VARNAME">temp_tablespaces</tt> to be set to names that are
        not known. This is because they might be known in another
        database where the setting is intended to be used, or for
        the tablespace cases because the tablespace might not be
        created yet. The same issue was previously recognized for
        <tt class="VARNAME">search_path</tt>, and these settings
        now act like that one.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Avoid crashing when we have problems deleting table
        files post-commit (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Dropping a table should lead to deleting the underlying
        disk files only after the transaction commits. In event of
        failure then (for instance, because of wrong file
        permissions) the code is supposed to just emit a warning
        message and go on, since it's too late to abort the
        transaction. This logic got broken as of release 8.4,
        causing such situations to result in a PANIC and an
        unrestartable database.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Recover from errors occurring during WAL replay of
        <tt class="COMMAND">DROP TABLESPACE</tt> (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Replay will attempt to remove the tablespace's
        directories, but there are various reasons why this might
        fail (for example, incorrect ownership or permissions on
        those directories). Formerly the replay code would panic,
        rendering the database unrestartable without manual
        intervention. It seems better to log the problem and
        continue, since the only consequence of failure to remove
        the directories is some wasted disk space.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix race condition in logging AccessExclusiveLocks for
        hot standby (Simon Riggs)</p>

        <p>Sometimes a lock would be logged as being held by
        <span class="QUOTE">"transaction zero"</span>. This is at
        least known to produce assertion failures on slave servers,
        and might be the cause of more serious problems.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Track the OID counter correctly during WAL replay, even
        when it wraps around (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Previously the OID counter would remain stuck at a high
        value until the system exited replay mode. The practical
        consequences of that are usually nil, but there are
        scenarios wherein a standby server that's been promoted to
        master might take a long time to advance the OID counter to
        a reasonable value once values are needed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Prevent emitting misleading <span class=
        "QUOTE">"consistent recovery state reached"</span> log
        message at the beginning of crash recovery (Heikki
        Linnakangas)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix initial value of <tt class=
        "STRUCTNAME">pg_stat_replication</tt>.<tt class=
        "STRUCTFIELD">replay_location</tt> (Fujii Masao)</p>

        <p>Previously, the value shown would be wrong until at
        least one WAL record had been replayed.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix regular expression back-references with <tt class=
        "LITERAL">*</tt> attached (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Rather than enforcing an exact string match, the code
        would effectively accept any string that satisfies the
        pattern sub-expression referenced by the back-reference
        symbol.</p>

        <p>A similar problem still afflicts back-references that
        are embedded in a larger quantified expression, rather than
        being the immediate subject of the quantifier. This will be
        addressed in a future <span class=
        "PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> release.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix recently-introduced memory leak in processing of
        <tt class="TYPE">inet</tt>/<tt class="TYPE">cidr</tt>
        values (Heikki Linnakangas)</p>

        <p>A patch in the December 2011 releases of <span class=
        "PRODUCTNAME">PostgreSQL</span> caused memory leakage in
        these operations, which could be significant in scenarios
        such as building a btree index on such a column.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix dangling pointer after <tt class="COMMAND">CREATE
        TABLE AS</tt>/<tt class="COMMAND">SELECT INTO</tt> in a
        SQL-language function (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>In most cases this only led to an assertion failure in
        assert-enabled builds, but worse consequences seem
        possible.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Avoid double close of file handle in syslogger on
        Windows (MauMau)</p>

        <p>Ordinarily this error was invisible, but it would cause
        an exception when running on a debug version of
        Windows.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix I/O-conversion-related memory leaks in plpgsql
        (Andres Freund, Jan Urbanski, Tom Lane)</p>

        <p>Certain operations would leak memory until the end of
        the current function.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Improve <span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span>'s
        handling of inherited table columns (Tom Lane)</p>

        <p><span class="APPLICATION">pg_dump</span> mishandled
        situations where a child column has a different default
        expression than its parent column. If the default is
        textually identical to the parent's default, but not
        actually the same (for instance, because of schema search
        path differences) it would not be recognized as different,
        so that after dump and restore the child would be allowed
        to inherit the parent's default. Child columns that are
        <tt class="LITERAL">NOT NULL</tt> where their parent is not
        could also be restored subtly incorrectly.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix <span class="APPLICATION">pg_restore</span>'s
        direct-to-database mode for INSERT-style table data (Tom
        Lane)</p>

        <p>Direct-to-database restores from archive files made with
        <tt class="OPTION">--inserts</tt> or <tt class=
        "OPTION">--column-inserts</tt> options fail when using
        <span class="APPLICATION">pg_restore</span> from a release
        dated September or December 2011, as a result of an
        oversight in a fix for another problem. The archive file
        itself is not at fault, and text-mode output is okay.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Allow <span class="APPLICATION">pg_upgrade</span> to
        process tables containing <tt class="TYPE">regclass</tt>
        columns (Bruce Momjian)</p>

        <p>Since <span class="APPLICATION">pg_upgrade</span> now
        takes care to preserve <tt class="STRUCTNAME">pg_class</tt>
        OIDs, there was no longer any reason for this
        restriction.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Make <span class="APPLICATION">libpq</span> ignore
        <tt class="LITERAL">ENOTDIR</tt> errors when looking for an
        SSL client certificate file (Magnus Hagander)</p>

        <p>This allows SSL connections to be established, though
        without a certificate, even when the user's home directory
        is set to something like <tt class=
        "LITERAL">/dev/null</tt>.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix some more field alignment issues in <span class=
        "APPLICATION">ecpg</span>'s SQLDA area (Zoltan
        Boszormenyi)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Allow <tt class="LITERAL">AT</tt> option in <span class=
        "APPLICATION">ecpg</span> <tt class=
        "LITERAL">DEALLOCATE</tt> statements (Michael Meskes)</p>

        <p>The infrastructure to support this has been there for
        awhile, but through an oversight there was still an error
        check rejecting the case.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Do not use the variable name when defining a varchar
        structure in ecpg (Michael Meskes)</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix <tt class="FILENAME">contrib/auto_explain</tt>'s
        JSON output mode to produce valid JSON (Andrew Dunstan)</p>

        <p>The output used brackets at the top level, when it
        should have used braces.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix error in <tt class=
        "FILENAME">contrib/intarray</tt>'s <tt class=
        "LITERAL">int[] &amp; int[]</tt> operator (Guillaume
        Lelarge)</p>

        <p>If the smallest integer the two input arrays have in
        common is 1, and there are smaller values in either array,
        then 1 would be incorrectly omitted from the result.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix error detection in <tt class=
        "FILENAME">contrib/pgcrypto</tt>'s <code class=
        "FUNCTION">encrypt_iv()</code> and <code class=
        "FUNCTION">decrypt_iv()</code> (Marko Kreen)</p>

        <p>These functions failed to report certain types of
        invalid-input errors, and would instead return random
        garbage values for incorrect input.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Fix one-byte buffer overrun in <tt class=
        "FILENAME">contrib/test_parser</tt> (Paul Guyot)</p>

        <p>The code would try to read one more byte than it should,
        which would crash in corner cases. Since <tt class=
        "FILENAME">contrib/test_parser</tt> is only example code,
        this is not a security issue in itself, but bad example
        code is still bad.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Use <code class=
        "FUNCTION">__sync_lock_test_and_set()</code> for spinlocks
        on ARM, if available (Martin Pitt)</p>

        <p>This function replaces our previous use of the
        <tt class="LITERAL">SWPB</tt> instruction, which is
        deprecated and not available on ARMv6 and later. Reports
        suggest that the old code doesn't fail in an obvious way on
        recent ARM boards, but simply doesn't interlock concurrent
        accesses, leading to bizarre failures in multiprocess
        operation.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Use <tt class="OPTION">-fexcess-precision=standard</tt>
        option when building with gcc versions that accept it
        (Andrew Dunstan)</p>

        <p>This prevents assorted scenarios wherein recent versions
        of gcc will produce creative results.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p>Allow use of threaded Python on FreeBSD (Chris Rees)</p>

        <p>Our configure script previously believed that this
        combination wouldn't work; but FreeBSD fixed the problem,
        so remove that error check.</p>
