<p><b>Release date:</b> 2014-02-20</p>
</div>
<p>This release contains a variety of fixes from 9.3.2. For

Migration to Version 9.3.3</a></h2>
<p>A dump/restore is not required for those running 9.3.X.</p>
<p>However, several of the issues corrected in this release could
have resulted in corruption of foreign-key constraints; that is,
there might now be referencing rows for which there is no matching
row in the referenced table. It may be worthwhile to recheck such
constraints after installing this update. The simplest way to do
that is to drop and recreate each suspect constraint; however, that
will require taking an exclusive lock on both tables, so it is
unlikely to be acceptable in production databases. Alternatively,
you can do a manual join query between the two tables to look for
unmatched rows.</p>
<p>Note also the requirement for replication standby servers to be
upgraded before their master server is upgraded.</p>
<p>Also, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 9.3.2,
see <a href="release-9-3-2.html">Section E.24</a>.</p>

Changes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shore up <tt class="LITERAL">GRANT ... WITH ADMIN OPTION</tt>
restrictions (Noah Misch)</p>
<p>Granting a role without <tt class="LITERAL">ADMIN OPTION</tt> is
supposed to prevent the grantee from adding or removing members
from the granted role, but this restriction was easily bypassed by
doing <tt class="LITERAL">SET ROLE</tt> first. The security impact
is mostly that a role member can revoke the access of others,
contrary to the wishes of his grantor. Unapproved role member
additions are a lesser concern, since an uncooperative role member
could provide most of his rights to others anyway by creating views
or <tt class="LITERAL">SECURITY DEFINER</tt> functions.
(CVE-2014-0060)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent privilege escalation via manual calls to PL validator
functions (Andres Freund)</p>
<p>The primary role of PL validator functions is to be called
implicitly during <tt class="COMMAND">CREATE FUNCTION</tt>, but
they are also normal SQL functions that a user can call explicitly.
Calling a validator on a function actually written in some other
language was not checked for and could be exploited for
privilege-escalation purposes. The fix involves adding a call to a
privilege-checking function in each validator function. Non-core
procedural languages will also need to make this change to their
own validator functions, if any. (CVE-2014-0061)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid multiple name lookups during table and index DDL (Robert
Haas, Andres Freund)</p>
<p>If the name lookups come to different conclusions due to
concurrent activity, we might perform some parts of the DDL on a
different table than other parts. At least in the case of
<tt class="COMMAND">CREATE INDEX</tt>, this can be used to cause
the permissions checks to be performed against a different table
than the index creation, allowing for a privilege escalation
attack. (CVE-2014-0062)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent buffer overrun with long datetime strings (Noah
Misch)</p>
<p>The <tt class="LITERAL">MAXDATELEN</tt> constant was too small
for the longest possible value of type <tt class=
"TYPE">interval</tt>, allowing a buffer overrun in <code class=
"FUNCTION">interval_out()</code>. Although the datetime input
functions were more careful about avoiding buffer overrun, the
limit was short enough to cause them to reject some valid inputs,
such as input containing a very long timezone name. The
<span class="APPLICATION">ecpg</span> library contained these
vulnerabilities along with some of its own. (CVE-2014-0063)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent buffer overrun due to integer overflow in size
calculations (Noah Misch, Heikki Linnakangas)</p>
<p>Several functions, mostly type input functions, calculated an
allocation size without checking for overflow. If overflow did
occur, a too-small buffer would be allocated and then written past.
(CVE-2014-0064)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent overruns of fixed-size buffers (Peter Eisentraut, Jozef
Mlich)</p>
<p>Use <code class="FUNCTION">strlcpy()</code> and related
functions to provide a clear guarantee that fixed-size buffers are
not overrun. Unlike the preceding items, it is unclear whether
these cases really represent live issues, since in most cases there
appear to be previous constraints on the size of the input string.
Nonetheless it seems prudent to silence all Coverity warnings of
this type. (CVE-2014-0065)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid crashing if <code class="FUNCTION">crypt()</code> returns
NULL (Honza Horak, Bruce Momjian)</p>
<p>There are relatively few scenarios in which <code class=
"FUNCTION">crypt()</code> could return NULL, but <tt class=
"FILENAME">contrib/chkpass</tt> would crash if it did. One
practical case in which this could be an issue is if <span class=
"APPLICATION">libc</span> is configured to refuse to execute
unapproved hashing algorithms (e.g., <span class="QUOTE">"FIPS
mode"</span>). (CVE-2014-0066)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document risks of <tt class="LITERAL">make check</tt> in the
regression testing instructions (Noah Misch, Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Since the temporary server started by <tt class="LITERAL">make
check</tt> uses <span class="QUOTE">"trust"</span> authentication,
another user on the same machine could connect to it as database
superuser, and then potentially exploit the privileges of the
operating-system user who started the tests. A future release will
probably incorporate changes in the testing procedure to prevent
this risk, but some public discussion is needed first. So for the
moment, just warn people against using <tt class="LITERAL">make
check</tt> when there are untrusted users on the same machine.
(CVE-2014-0067)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework tuple freezing protocol (Álvaro Herrera, Andres
Freund)</p>
<p>The logic for tuple freezing was unable to handle some cases
involving freezing of <a href=
"routine-vacuuming.html#VACUUM-FOR-MULTIXACT-WRAPAROUND"><i class=
"FIRSTTERM">multixact</i> IDs</a>, with the practical effect that
shared row-level locks might be forgotten once old enough.</p>
<p>Fixing this required changing the WAL record format for tuple
freezing. While this is no issue for standalone servers, when using
replication it means that <span class=
"emphasis EMPHASIS c2">standby servers must be upgraded to 9.3.3 or
later before their masters are</span>. An older standby will be
unable to interpret freeze records generated by a newer master, and
will fail with a PANIC message. (In such a case, upgrading the
standby should be sufficient to let it resume execution.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create separate GUC parameters to control multixact freezing
(Álvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>9.3 requires multixact tuple labels to be frozen before they
grow too old, in the same fashion as plain transaction ID labels
have been frozen for some time. Previously, the transaction ID
freezing parameters were used for multixact IDs too; but since the
consumption rates of transaction IDs and multixact IDs can be quite
different, this did not work very well. Introduce new settings
<a href=
"runtime-config-client.html#GUC-VACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-MIN-AGE">vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age</a>,
<a href=
"runtime-config-client.html#GUC-VACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-TABLE-AGE">vacuum_multixact_freeze_table_age</a>,
and <a href=
"runtime-config-autovacuum.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-MULTIXACT-FREEZE-MAX-AGE">
autovacuum_multixact_freeze_max_age</a> to control when to freeze
multixacts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account for remote row locks propagated by local updates (Álvaro
Herrera)</p>
<p>If a row was locked by transaction A, and transaction B updated
it, the new version of the row created by B would be locked by A,
yet visible only to B. If transaction B then again updated the row,
A's lock wouldn't get checked, thus possibly allowing B to complete
when it shouldn't. This case is new in 9.3 since prior versions did
not have any types of row locking that would permit another
transaction to update the row at all.</p>
<p>This oversight could allow referential integrity checks to give
false positives (for instance, allow deletes that should have been
rejected). Applications using the new commands <tt class=
"LITERAL">SELECT FOR KEY SHARE</tt> and <tt class="LITERAL">SELECT
FOR NO KEY UPDATE</tt> might also have suffered locking failures of
this kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent <span class="QUOTE">"forgetting"</span> valid row locks
when one of several holders of a row lock aborts (Álvaro
Herrera)</p>
<p>This was yet another mechanism by which a shared row lock could
be lost, thus possibly allowing updates that should have been
prevented by foreign-key constraints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix incorrect logic during update chain locking (Álvaro
Herrera)</p>
<p>This mistake could result in spurious <span class="QUOTE">"could
not serialize access due to concurrent update"</span> errors in
<tt class="LITERAL">REPEATABLE READ</tt> and <tt class=
"LITERAL">SERIALIZABLE</tt> transaction isolation modes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle wraparound correctly during extension or truncation of
<tt class="FILENAME">pg_multixact/members</tt> (Andres Freund,
Álvaro Herrera)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix handling of 5-digit filenames in <tt class=
"FILENAME">pg_multixact/members</tt> (Álvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>As of 9.3, these names can be more than 4 digits, but the
directory cleanup code ignored such files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve performance of multixact cache code (Álvaro Herrera)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimize updating a row that's already locked by the same
transaction (Andres Freund, Álvaro Herrera)</p>
<p>This fixes a performance regression from pre-9.3 versions when
doing <tt class="LITERAL">SELECT FOR UPDATE</tt> followed by
<tt class="LITERAL">UPDATE/DELETE</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During archive recovery, prefer highest timeline number when WAL
segments with the same ID are present in both the archive and
<tt class="FILENAME">pg_xlog/</tt> (Kyotaro Horiguchi)</p>
<p>Previously, not-yet-archived segments could get ignored during
recovery. This reverts an undesirable behavioral change in 9.3.0
back to the way things worked pre-9.3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible mis-replay of WAL records when some segments of a
relation aren't full size (Greg Stark, Tom Lane)</p>
<p>The WAL update could be applied to the wrong page, potentially
many pages past where it should have been. Aside from corrupting
data, this error has been observed to result in significant
<span class="QUOTE">"bloat"</span> of standby servers compared to
their masters, due to updates being applied far beyond where the
end-of-file should have been. This failure mode does not appear to
be a significant risk during crash recovery, only when initially
synchronizing a standby created from a base backup taken from a
quickly-changing master.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix bug in determining when recovery has reached consistency
(Tomonari Katsumata, Heikki Linnakangas)</p>
<p>In some cases WAL replay would mistakenly conclude that the
database was already consistent at the start of replay, thus
possibly allowing hot-standby queries before the database was
really consistent. Other symptoms such as <span class=
"QUOTE">"PANIC: WAL contains references to invalid pages"</span>
were also possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix WAL logging of visibility map changes (Heikki
Linnakangas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix improper locking of btree index pages while replaying a
<tt class="LITERAL">VACUUM</tt> operation in hot-standby mode
(Andres Freund, Heikki Linnakangas, Tom Lane)</p>
<p>This error could result in <span class="QUOTE">"PANIC: WAL
contains references to invalid pages"</span> failures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that insertions into non-leaf GIN index pages write a
full-page WAL record when appropriate (Heikki Linnakangas)</p>
<p>The previous coding risked index corruption in the event of a
partial-page write during a system crash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When <tt class="LITERAL">pause_at_recovery_target</tt> and
<tt class="LITERAL">recovery_target_inclusive</tt> are both set,
ensure the target record is applied before pausing, not after
(Heikki Linnakangas)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure walreceiver sends hot-standby feedback messages on time
even when there is a continuous stream of data (Andres Freund, Amit
Kapila)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent timeout interrupts from taking control away from
mainline code unless <tt class="VARNAME">ImmediateInterruptOK</tt>
is set (Andres Freund, Tom Lane)</p>
<p>This is a serious issue for any application making use of
statement timeouts, as it could cause all manner of strange
failures after a timeout occurred. We have seen reports of
<span class="QUOTE">"stuck"</span> spinlocks, ERRORs being
unexpectedly promoted to PANICs, unkillable backends, and other
misbehaviors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix race conditions during server process exit (Robert Haas)</p>
<p>Ensure that signal handlers don't attempt to use the process's
<tt class="VARNAME">MyProc</tt> pointer after it's no longer
valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix race conditions in walsender shutdown logic and walreceiver
SIGHUP signal handler (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix unsafe references to <tt class="VARNAME">errno</tt> within
error reporting logic (Christian Kruse)</p>
<p>This would typically lead to odd behaviors such as missing or
inappropriate <tt class="LITERAL">HINT</tt> fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible crashes from using <code class=
"FUNCTION">ereport()</code> too early during server startup (Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>The principal case we've seen in the field is a crash if the
server is started in a directory it doesn't have permission to
read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear retry flags properly in OpenSSL socket write function
(Alexander Kukushkin)</p>
<p>This omission could result in a server lockup after unexpected
loss of an SSL-encrypted connection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix length checking for Unicode identifiers (<tt class=
"LITERAL">U&amp;"..."</tt> syntax) containing escapes (Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>A spurious truncation warning would be printed for such
identifiers if the escaped form of the identifier was too long, but
the identifier actually didn't need truncation after
de-escaping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix parsing of Unicode literals and identifiers just before the
end of a command string or function body (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Allow keywords that are type names to be used in lists of roles
(Stephen Frost)</p>
<p>A previous patch allowed such keywords to be used without
quoting in places such as role identifiers; but it missed cases
where a list of role identifiers was permitted, such as <tt class=
"LITERAL">DROP ROLE</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix parser crash for <tt class="LITERAL">EXISTS(SELECT * FROM
zero_column_table)</tt> (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible crash due to invalid plan for nested sub-selects,
such as <tt class="LITERAL">WHERE (... x IN (SELECT ...) ...) IN
(SELECT ...)</tt> (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix mishandling of <tt class="LITERAL">WHERE</tt> conditions
pulled up from a <tt class="LITERAL">LATERAL</tt> subquery (Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>The typical symptom of this bug was a <span class="QUOTE">"JOIN
qualification cannot refer to other relations"</span> error, though
subtle logic errors in created plans seem possible as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disallow <tt class="LITERAL">LATERAL</tt> references to the
target table of an <tt class="LITERAL">UPDATE/DELETE</tt> (Tom
Lane)</p>
<p>While this might be allowed in some future release, it was
unintentional in 9.3, and didn't work quite right anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="LITERAL">UPDATE/DELETE</tt> of an inherited
target table that has <tt class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</tt> subqueries
(Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Without this fix, <tt class="LITERAL">UNION ALL</tt> subqueries
aren't correctly inserted into the update plans for inheritance
child tables after the first one, typically resulting in no update
happening for those child table(s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="COMMAND">ANALYZE</tt> to not fail on a column
that's a domain over a range type (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure that <tt class="COMMAND">ANALYZE</tt> creates statistics
for a table column even when all the values in it are <span class=
"QUOTE">"too wide"</span> (Tom Lane)</p>
<p><tt class="COMMAND">ANALYZE</tt> intentionally omits very wide
values from its histogram and most-common-values calculations, but
it neglected to do something sane in the case that all the sampled
entries are too wide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <tt class="LITERAL">ALTER TABLE ... SET TABLESPACE</tt>,
allow the database's default tablespace to be used without a
permissions check (Stephen Frost)</p>
<p><tt class="LITERAL">CREATE TABLE</tt> has always allowed such
usage, but <tt class="LITERAL">ALTER TABLE</tt> didn't get the
memo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix support for extensions containing event triggers (Tom
Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <span class="QUOTE">"cannot accept a set"</span> error when
some arms of a <tt class="LITERAL">CASE</tt> return a set and
others don't (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix memory leakage in JSON functions (Craig Ringer)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly distinguish numbers from non-numbers when generating
JSON output (Andrew Dunstan)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix checks for all-zero client addresses in pgstat functions
(Kevin Grittner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible misclassification of multibyte characters by the
text search parser (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Non-ASCII characters could be misclassified when using C locale
with a multibyte encoding. On Cygwin, non-C locales could fail as
well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible misbehavior in <code class=
"FUNCTION">plainto_tsquery()</code> (Heikki Linnakangas)</p>
<p>Use <code class="FUNCTION">memmove()</code> not <code class=
"FUNCTION">memcpy()</code> for copying overlapping memory regions.
There have been no field reports of this actually causing trouble,
but it's certainly risky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix placement of permissions checks in <code class=
"FUNCTION">pg_start_backup()</code> and <code class=
"FUNCTION">pg_stop_backup()</code> (Andres Freund, Magnus
Hagander)</p>
<p>The previous coding might attempt to do catalog access when it
shouldn't.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accept <tt class="LITERAL">SHIFT_JIS</tt> as an encoding name
for locale checking purposes (Tatsuo Ishii)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="LITERAL">*</tt>-qualification of named parameters
in SQL-language functions (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>Given a composite-type parameter named <tt class=
"LITERAL">foo</tt>, <tt class="LITERAL">$1.*</tt> worked fine, but
<tt class="LITERAL">foo.*</tt> not so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix misbehavior of <code class="FUNCTION">PQhost()</code> on
Windows (Fujii Masao)</p>
<p>It should return <tt class="LITERAL">localhost</tt> if no host
has been specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve error handling in <span class="APPLICATION">libpq</span>
and <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span> for failures during
<tt class="LITERAL">COPY TO STDOUT/FROM STDIN</tt> (Tom Lane)</p>
<p>In particular this fixes an infinite loop that could occur in
9.2 and up if the server connection was lost during <tt class=
"LITERAL">COPY FROM STDIN</tt>. Variants of that scenario might be
possible in older versions, or with other client applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix incorrect translation handling in some <span class=
"APPLICATION">psql</span> <tt class="LITERAL">\d</tt> commands
(Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure <span class="APPLICATION">pg_basebackup</span>'s
background process is killed when exiting its foreground process
(Magnus Hagander)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix possible incorrect printing of filenames in <span class=
"APPLICATION">pg_basebackup</span>'s verbose mode (Magnus
Hagander)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid including tablespaces inside PGDATA twice in base backups
(Dimitri Fontaine, Magnus Hagander)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix misaligned descriptors in <span class=
"APPLICATION">ecpg</span> (MauMau)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <span class="APPLICATION">ecpg</span>, handle lack of a
hostname in the connection parameters properly (Michael Meskes)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix performance regression in <tt class=
"FILENAME">contrib/dblink</tt> connection startup (Joe Conway)</p>
<p>Avoid an unnecessary round trip when client and server encodings
match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <tt class="FILENAME">contrib/isn</tt>, fix incorrect
calculation of the check digit for ISMN values (Fabien Coelho)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="FILENAME">contrib/pgbench</tt>'s progress logging
to avoid overflow when the scale factor is large (Tatsuo Ishii)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix <tt class="FILENAME">contrib/pg_stat_statement</tt>'s
handling of <tt class="LITERAL">CURRENT_DATE</tt> and related
constructs (Kyotaro Horiguchi)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve lost-connection error handling in <tt class=
"FILENAME">contrib/postgres_fdw</tt> (Tom Lane)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure client-code-only installation procedure works as
documented (Peter Eisentraut)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Mingw and Cygwin builds, install the <span class=
"APPLICATION">libpq</span> DLL in the <tt class="FILENAME">bin</tt>
directory (Andrew Dunstan)</p>
<p>This duplicates what the MSVC build has long done. It should fix
problems with programs like <span class="APPLICATION">psql</span>
failing to start because they can't find the DLL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoid using the deprecated <tt class="LITERAL">dllwrap</tt> tool
in Cygwin builds (Marco Atzeri)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable building with Visual Studio 2013 (Brar Piening)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't generate plain-text <tt class="FILENAME">HISTORY</tt> and
<tt class="FILENAME">src/test/regress/README</tt> files anymore
(Tom Lane)</p>
<p>These text files duplicated the main HTML and PDF documentation
formats. The trouble involved in maintaining them greatly outweighs
the likely audience for plain-text format. Distribution tarballs
will still contain files by these names, but they'll just be stubs
directing the reader to consult the main documentation. The
plain-text <tt class="FILENAME">INSTALL</tt> file will still be
maintained, as there is arguably a use-case for that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Update time zone data files to <span class=
"APPLICATION">tzdata</span> release 2013i for DST law changes in
Jordan and historical changes in Cuba.</p>
<p>In addition, the zones <tt class="LITERAL">Asia/Riyadh87</tt>,
<tt class="LITERAL">Asia/Riyadh88</tt>, and <tt class=
"LITERAL">Asia/Riyadh89</tt> have been removed, as they are no
longer maintained by IANA, and never represented actual civil
timekeeping practice.</p>
