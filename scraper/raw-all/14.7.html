          <p><span class="application">libpq</span> can leak memory contents after GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion)</p>
          <p>A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos) transport encryption. <span class="application">libpq</span> will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report. Depending on what the calling application does with the error report, this could result in disclosure of application memory contents. There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading beyond the end of memory. Fix by properly zero-terminating the server message. (CVE-2022-41862)</p>

          <p>Fix calculation of which <code class="literal">GENERATED</code> columns need to be updated in child tables during an <code class="command">UPDATE</code> on a partitioned table or inheritance tree (Amit Langote, Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>This fixes failure to update <code class="literal">GENERATED</code> columns that do not exist in the parent table, or that have different dependencies than are in the parent column's generation expression.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Allow a <code class="literal">WITH RECURSIVE ... CYCLE</code> CTE to access its output column (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>A reference to the <code class="literal">SET</code> column from within the CTE would fail with <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cache lookup failed for type 0</span>”</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix handling of pending inserts when doing a bulk insertion to a foreign table (Etsuro Fujita)</p>
          <p>In some cases pending insertions were not flushed to the FDW soon enough, leading to logical inconsistencies, for example <code class="literal">BEFORE ROW</code> triggers not seeing rows they should be able to see.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Allow <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code> to be set on an index that's not (yet) valid (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>When <span class="application">pg_dump</span> dumps a partitioned index that's marked <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code>, it generates a command sequence that applies <code class="literal">REPLICA IDENTITY</code> before the partitioned index has been marked valid, causing restore to fail. There seems no very good reason to prohibit doing it in that order, so allow it. The marking will have no effect anyway until the index becomes valid.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix handling of <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> markers in rules that perform an <code class="command">INSERT</code> from a multi-row <code class="literal">VALUES</code> list (Dean Rasheed)</p>
          <p>In some cases a <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> marker would not get replaced with the proper default-value expression, leading to an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unrecognized node type</span>”</span> error.</p>

        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Reject uses of undefined variables in <code class="type">jsonpath</code> existence checks (Alexander Korotkov, David G. Johnston)</p>
          <p>While <code class="type">jsonpath</code> match operators threw an error for an undefined variable in the path pattern, the existence operators silently treated it as a match.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix <code class="type">jsonb</code> subscripting to cope with toasted subscript values (Tom Lane, David G. Johnston)</p>
          <p>Using a text value fetched directly from a table as a <code class="type">jsonb</code> subscript was likely to fail. Fetches would usually not find any matching element. Assignments could store the value with a garbage key, although keys long enough to cause that problem are probably rare in the field.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix edge-case data corruption in parallel hash joins (Dmitry Astapov)</p>
          <p>If the final chunk of a large tuple being written out to a temporary file was exactly 32760 bytes, it would be corrupted due to a fencepost bug. The query would typically fail later with corrupted-data symptoms.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Honor non-default settings of <code class="varname">checkpoint_completion_target</code> (Bharath Rupireddy)</p>
          <p>Internal state was not updated after a change in <code class="varname">checkpoint_completion_target</code>, possibly resulting in performing checkpoint I/O faster or slower than desired, especially if that setting was changed on-the-fly.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Log the correct ending timestamp in <code class="varname">recovery_target_xid</code> mode (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>When ending recovery based on the <code class="varname">recovery_target_xid</code> setting with <code class="varname">recovery_target_inclusive</code> = <code class="literal">off</code>, we printed an incorrect timestamp (always 2000-01-01) in the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">recovery stopping before ... transaction</span>”</span> log message.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Improve error reporting for some buffered file read failures (Peter Eisentraut)</p>
          <p>Correctly report a short read, giving the numbers of bytes desired and actually read, instead of reporting an irrelevant error code. Most places got this right already, but some recently-written replication logic did not.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>In extended query protocol, avoid an immediate commit after <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> if we're running a pipeline (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>If there's not been an explicit <code class="command">BEGIN TRANSACTION</code>, <code class="command">ANALYZE</code> would take it on itself to commit, which should not happen within a pipelined series of commands.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length (Andrey Borodin)</p>
          <p>The server would process a cancel request even if its length word was too small. This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer. In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be very close to the end of memory. The more likely outcome was a bogus log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code. Complain about the wrong length, instead.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Add recursion and looping defenses in subquery pullup (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>A contrived query can result in deep recursion and unreasonable amounts of time spent trying to flatten subqueries. A proper fix for that seems unduly invasive for a back-patch, but we can at least add stack depth checks and an interrupt check to allow the query to be cancelled.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix planner issues when combining Memoize nodes with partitionwise joins or parameterized nestloops (Richard Guo)</p>
          <p>These errors could lead to not using Memoize in contexts where it would be useful, or possibly to wrong query plans.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix partitionwise-join code to tolerate failure to produce a plan for each partition (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>This could result in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">could not devise a query plan for the given query</span>”</span> errors.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Limit the amount of cleanup work done by <code class="function">get_actual_variable_range</code> (Simon Riggs)</p>
          <p>Planner runs occurring just after deletion of a large number of tuples appearing at the end of an index could expend significant amounts of work setting the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">killed</span>”</span> bits for those index entries. Limit the amount of work done in any one query by giving up on this process after examining 100 heap pages. All the cleanup will still happen eventually, but without so large a performance hiccup.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix under-parenthesized display of <code class="literal">AT TIME ZONE</code> constructs (Tom Lane)</p>
          <p>This could result in dump/restore failures for rules or views in which an argument of <code class="literal">AT TIME ZONE</code> is itself an expression.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Prevent clobbering of cached parsetrees for utility statements in SQL functions (Tom Lane, Daniel Gustafsson)</p>
          <p>If a SQL-language function executes the same utility command more than once within a single calling query, it could crash or report strange errors such as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unrecognized node type</span>”</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Ensure that execution of full-text-search queries can be cancelled while they are performing phrase matches (Tom Lane)</p>

          <p>Fix memory leak in hashing strings with nondeterministic collations (Jeff Davis)</p>

        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix deadlock between <code class="command">DROP DATABASE</code> and logical replication worker process (Hou Zhijie)</p>
          <p>This was caused by an ill-advised choice to block interrupts while creating a logical replication slot in the worker. In version 15 that could lead to an undetected deadlock. In version 14, no deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block interrupts while waiting for network I/O.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Clean up the <span class="application">libpq</span> connection object after a failed replication connection attempt (Andres Freund)</p>
          <p>The previous coding leaked the connection object. In background code paths that's pretty harmless because the calling process will give up and exit. But in commands such as <code class="command">CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</code>, such a failure resulted in a small session-lifespan memory leak.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>In hot-standby servers, reduce processing effort for tracking XIDs known to be active on the primary (Simon Riggs, Michail Nikolaev)</p>
          <p>Insufficiently-aggressive cleanup of the KnownAssignedXids array could lead to poor performance, particularly when <code class="varname">max_connections</code> is set to a large value on the standby.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Ignore invalidated logical-replication slots while determining oldest catalog xmin (Sirisha Chamarthi)</p>
          <p>A replication slot could prevent cleanup of dead tuples in the system catalogs even after it becomes invalidated due to exceeding <code class="varname">max_slot_wal_keep_size</code>. Thus, failure of a replication consumer could lead to indefinitely-large catalog bloat.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>In logical decoding, notify the remote node when a transaction is detected to have crashed (Hou Zhijie)</p>
          <p>After a server restart, we'll re-stream the changes for transactions occurring shortly before the restart. Some of these transactions probably never completed; when we realize that one didn't we throw away the relevant decoding state locally, but we neglected to tell the subscriber about it. That led to the subscriber keeping useless streaming files until it's next restarted.</p>
        </li>
        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Fix uninitialized-memory usage in logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada)</p>
          <p>In certain cases, resumption of logical decoding could try to re-use XID data that had already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.</p>

        <li class="listitem">
          <p>Advance a heap page's LSN when setting its all-visible bit during WAL replay (Jeff Davis)</p>
          <p>Failure to do this left the page possibly different on standby servers than the primary, and violated some other expectations about when the LSN changes. This seems only a theoretical hazard so far as <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span> itself is concerned, but it could upset third-party tools.</p>

          <p>Remove various assumptions that <code class="structfield">rd_smgr</code> would stay valid over a series of operations, by wrapping all uses of it in a function that will recompute it if needed. This prevents bugs occurring when an unexpected cache flush occurs partway through such a series.</p>

          <p>This function misbehaved with some values of its second argument. No such usages exist in core <span class="productname">PostgreSQL</span>, but it's clearly a hazard for external modules, so repair.</p>
