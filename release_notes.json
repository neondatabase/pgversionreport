        "Significant general performance improvements",
        "Improve hash index performance (Amit Kapila, Mithun Cy, Ashutosh Sharma)",
        "Allow faster GiST inserts and updates by reusing index space more efficiently (Andrey Borodin)",
        "Improve performance of queries affected by row-level security restrictions (Tom Lane)\nThe optimizer now has more knowledge about where it can place RLS filter conditions, allowing better plans to be generated while still enforcing the RLS conditions safely.",
        "Speed up aggregate functions that calculate a running sum using numeric-type arithmetic, including some variants of `SUM()()`, `AVG()()`, and `STDDEV()()` (Heikki Linnakangas)",
        "Improve performance of character encoding conversions by using radix trees (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Heikki Linnakangas)",
        "Improve sort performance of the macaddr data type (Brandur Leach)",
        "Improve performance of hot standby replay with better tracking of Access Exclusive locks (Simon Riggs, David Rowley)",

      ],
      "security": [
        "Add SCRAM-SHA-256 support for password negotiation and storage (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)\nThis provides better security than the existing `md5` negotiation and storage method.",
        "Allow restrictive row-level security policies (Stephen Frost)\nPreviously all security policies were permissive, meaning that any matching policy allowed access. A restrictive policy must match for access to be granted. These policy types can be combined.",
        "Issue `fsync()()` on the output files generated by pg_dump and pg_dumpall (Michael Paquier)\nThis provides more security that the output is safely stored on disk before the program exits. This can be disabled with the new --no-sync option."
      ],
      "features": [
        "Move sequences' metadata fields into a new pg_sequence system catalog (Peter Eisentraut)\nA sequence relation now stores only the fields that can be modified by `nextval()()`, that is last_value, log_cnt, and is_called. Other sequence properties, such as the starting value and increment, are kept in a corresponding row of the pg_sequence catalog. ALTER SEQUENCE updates are now fully transactional, implying that the sequence is locked until commit. The `nextval()()` and `setval()()` functions remain nontransactional.\nThe main incompatibility introduced by this change is that selecting from a sequence relation now returns only the three fields named above. To obtain the sequence's other properties, applications must look into pg_sequence. The new system view pg_sequences can also be used for this purpose; it provides column names that are more compatible with existing code.\nAlso, sequences created for `SERIAL` columns now generate positive 32-bit wide values, whereas previous versions generated 64-bit wide values. This has no visible effect if the values are only stored in a column.\nThe output of psql's \\d command for a sequence has been redesigned, too.",
        "Make pg_basebackup stream the WAL needed to restore the backup by default (Magnus Hagander)\nThis changes pg_basebackup's -X/--wal-method default to `stream`. An option value `none` has been added to reproduce the old behavior. The pg_basebackup option -x has been removed (instead, use `-X fetch`)."
      ],
      "other": [
        "Logical replication using publish/subscribe",
        "Declarative table partitioning",
        "Improved query parallelism",
        "Stronger password authentication based on SCRAM-SHA-256",
        "Improved monitoring and control",
        "Hash indexes must be rebuilt after pg_upgrade-ing from any previous major PostgreSQL version (Mithun Cy, Robert Haas, Amit Kapila)\nMajor hash index improvements necessitated this requirement. pg_upgrade will create a script to assist with this.",
        "Rename write-ahead log directory pg_xlog to pg_wal, and rename transaction status directory pg_clog to pg_xact (Michael Paquier)\nUsers have occasionally thought that these directories contained only inessential log files, and proceeded to remove write-ahead log files or transaction status files manually, causing irrecoverable data loss. These name changes are intended to discourage such errors in future.",
        "Rename SQL functions, tools, and options that reference “xlog” to “wal” (Robert Haas)\nFor example, `pg_switch_xlog()()` becomes `pg_switch_wal()()`, pg_receivexlog becomes pg_receivewal, and --xlogdir becomes --waldir. This is for consistency with the change of the pg_xlog directory name; in general, the “xlog” terminology is no longer used in any user-facing places.",
        "Rename WAL-related functions and views to use `lsn` instead of `location` (David Rowley)\nThere was previously an inconsistent mixture of the two terminologies.",
        "Change the implementation of set-returning functions appearing in a query's `SELECT` list (Andres Freund)\nSet-returning functions are now evaluated before evaluation of scalar expressions in the `SELECT` list, much as though they had been placed in a `LATERAL FROM`-clause item. This allows saner semantics for cases where multiple set-returning functions are present. If they return different numbers of rows, the shorter results are extended to match the longest result by adding nulls. Previously the results were cycled until they all terminated at the same time, producing a number of rows equal to the least common multiple of the functions' periods. In addition, set-returning functions are now disallowed within `CASE` and `COALESCE` constructs. For more information see Section&nbsp;37.4.8.",
        "Use standard row constructor syntax in `UPDATE ... SET (`column_list`) = row_constructor` (Tom Lane)\nThe `row_constructor` can now begin with the keyword `ROW`; previously that had to be omitted. If just one column name appears in the `column_list`, then the `row_constructor` now must use the `ROW` keyword, since otherwise it is not a valid row constructor but just a parenthesized expression. Also, an occurrence of ``table_name`.*` within the `row_constructor` is now expanded into multiple columns, as occurs in other uses of `row_constructor`s.",
        "When ALTER TABLE ... ADD PRIMARY KEY marks columns `NOT NULL`, that change now propagates to inheritance child tables as well (Michael Paquier)",
        "Prevent statement-level triggers from firing more than once per statement (Tom Lane)\nCases involving writable CTEs updating the same table updated by the containing statement, or by another writable CTE, fired `BEFORE STATEMENT` or `AFTER STATEMENT` triggers more than once. Also, if there were statement-level triggers on a table affected by a foreign key enforcement action (such as `ON DELETE CASCADE`), they could fire more than once per outer SQL statement. This is contrary to the SQL standard, so change it.",
        "Change how logical replication uses pg_hba.conf (Peter Eisentraut)\nIn previous releases, a logical replication connection required the `replication` keyword in the database column. As of this release, logical replication matches a normal entry with a database name or keywords such as `all`. Physical replication continues to use the `replication` keyword. Since built-in logical replication is new in this release, this change only affects users of third-party logical replication plugins.",
        "Make all pg_ctl actions wait for completion by default (Peter Eisentraut)\nPreviously some pg_ctl actions didn't wait for completion, and required the use of -w to do so.",
        "Change the default value of the log_directory server parameter from pg_log to log (Andreas Karlsson)",
        "Add configuration option ssl_dh_params_file to specify file name for custom OpenSSL DH parameters (Heikki Linnakangas)\nThis replaces the hardcoded, undocumented file name dh1024.pem. Note that dh1024.pem is no longer examined by default; you must set this option if you want to use custom DH parameters.",
        "Increase the size of the default DH parameters used for OpenSSL ephemeral DH ciphers to 2048 bits (Heikki Linnakangas)\nThe size of the compiled-in DH parameters has been increased from 1024 to 2048 bits, making DH key exchange more resistant to brute-force attacks. However, some old SSL implementations, notably some revisions of Java Runtime Environment version 6, will not accept DH parameters longer than 1024 bits, and hence will not be able to connect over SSL. If it's necessary to support such old clients, you can use custom 1024-bit DH parameters instead of the compiled-in defaults. See ssl_dh_params_file.",
        "Remove the ability to store unencrypted passwords on the server (Heikki Linnakangas)\nThe password_encryption server parameter no longer supports `off` or `plain`. The `UNENCRYPTED` option is no longer supported in CREATE/ALTER USER ... PASSWORD. Similarly, the --unencrypted option has been removed from createuser. Unencrypted passwords migrated from older versions will be stored encrypted in this release. The default setting for password_encryption is still `md5`.",
        "Add min_parallel_table_scan_size and min_parallel_index_scan_size server parameters to control parallel queries (Amit Kapila, Robert Haas)\nThese replace min_parallel_relation_size, which was found to be too generic.",
        "Don't downcase unquoted text within shared_preload_libraries and related server parameters (QL Zhuo)\nThese settings are really lists of file names, but they were previously treated as lists of SQL identifiers, which have different parsing rules.",
        "Remove sql_inheritance server parameter (Robert Haas)\nChanging this setting from the default value caused queries referencing parent tables to not include child tables. The SQL standard requires them to be included, however, and this has been the default since PostgreSQL 7.1.",
        "Allow multi-dimensional arrays to be passed into PL/Python functions, and returned as nested Python lists (Alexey Grishchenko, Dave Cramer, Heikki Linnakangas)\nThis feature requires a backwards-incompatible change to the handling of arrays of composite types in PL/Python. Previously, you could return an array of composite values by writing, e.g., `[[col1, col2], [col1, col2]]`; but now that is interpreted as a two-dimensional array. Composite types in arrays must now be written as Python tuples, not lists, to resolve the ambiguity; that is, write `[(col1, col2), (col1, col2)]` instead.",
        "Remove PL/Tcl's “module” auto-loading facility (Tom Lane)\nThis functionality has been replaced by new server parameters pltcl.start_proc and pltclu.start_proc, which are easier to use and more similar to features available in other PLs.",
        "Remove pg_dump/pg_dumpall support for dumping from pre-8.0 servers (Tom Lane)\nUsers needing to dump from pre-8.0 servers will need to use dump programs from PostgreSQL 9.6 or earlier. The resulting output should still load successfully into newer servers.",
        "Remove support for floating-point timestamps and intervals (Tom Lane)\nThis removes configure's --disable-integer-datetimes option. Floating-point timestamps have few advantages and have not been the default since PostgreSQL 8.3.",
        "Remove server support for client/server protocol version 1.0 (Tom Lane)\nThis protocol hasn't had client support since PostgreSQL 6.3.",
        "Remove contrib/tsearch2 module (Robert Haas)\nThis module provided compatibility with the version of full text search that shipped in pre-8.3 PostgreSQL releases.",
        "Remove createlang and droplang command-line applications (Peter Eisentraut)\nThese had been deprecated since PostgreSQL 9.1. Instead, use CREATE EXTENSION and DROP EXTENSION directly.",
        "Remove support for version-0 function calling conventions (Andres Freund)\nExtensions providing C-coded functions must now conform to version 1 calling conventions. Version 0 has been deprecated since 2001.",
        "Support parallel B-tree index scans (Rahila Syed, Amit Kapila, Robert Haas, Rafia Sabih)\nThis change allows B-tree index pages to be searched by separate parallel workers.",
        "Support parallel bitmap heap scans (Dilip Kumar)\nThis allows a single index scan to dispatch parallel workers to process different areas of the heap.",
        "Allow merge joins to be performed in parallel (Dilip Kumar)",
        "Allow non-correlated subqueries to be run in parallel (Amit Kapila)",
        "Improve ability of parallel workers to return pre-sorted data (Rushabh Lathia)",
        "Increase parallel query usage in procedural language functions (Robert Haas, Rafia Sabih)",
        "Add max_parallel_workers server parameter to limit the number of worker processes that can be used for query parallelism (Julien Rouhaud)\nThis parameter can be set lower than max_worker_processes to reserve worker processes for purposes other than parallel queries.",
        "Enable parallelism by default by changing the default setting of max_parallel_workers_per_gather to `2`.",
        "Add write-ahead logging support to hash indexes (Amit Kapila)\nThis makes hash indexes crash-safe and replicatable. The former warning message about their use is removed.",
        "Add SP-GiST index support for INET and CIDR data types (Emre Hasegeli)",
        "Add option to allow BRIN index summarization to happen more aggressively (Álvaro Herrera)\nA new CREATE INDEX option enables auto-summarization of the previous BRIN page range when a new page range is created.",
        "Add functions to remove and re-add BRIN summarization for BRIN index ranges (Álvaro Herrera)\nThe new SQL function `brin_summarize_range()()` updates BRIN index summarization for a specified range and `brin_desummarize_range()()` removes it. This is helpful to update summarization of a range that is now smaller due to UPDATEs and DELETEs.",
        "Improve accuracy in determining if a BRIN index scan is beneficial (David Rowley, Emre Hasegeli)",
        "Reduce page locking during vacuuming of GIN indexes (Andrey Borodin)",
        "Reduce locking required to change table parameters (Simon Riggs, Fabrízio Mello)\nFor example, changing a table's effective_io_concurrency setting can now be done with a more lightweight lock.",
        "Allow tuning of predicate lock promotion thresholds (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)\nLock promotion can now be controlled through two new server parameters, max_pred_locks_per_relation and max_pred_locks_per_page.",
        "Add multi-column optimizer statistics to compute the correlation ratio and number of distinct values (Tomas Vondra, David Rowley, Álvaro Herrera)\nNew commands are CREATE STATISTICS, ALTER STATISTICS, and DROP STATISTICS. This feature is helpful in estimating query memory usage and when combining the statistics from individual columns.",
        "Reduce expression evaluation overhead during query execution, as well as plan node calling overhead (Andres Freund)\nThis is particularly helpful for queries that process many rows.",
        "Allow hashed aggregation to be used with grouping sets (Andrew Gierth)",
        "Use uniqueness guarantees to optimize certain join types (David Rowley)",
        "Reduce statistics tracking overhead in sessions that reference many thousands of relations (Aleksander Alekseev)",
        "Allow explicit control over EXPLAIN's display of planning and execution time (Ashutosh Bapat)\nBy default planning and execution time are displayed by EXPLAIN ANALYZE and are not displayed in other cases. The new EXPLAIN option `SUMMARY` allows explicit control of this.",
        "Add default monitoring roles (Dave Page)\nNew roles `pg_monitor`, `pg_read_all_settings`, `pg_read_all_stats`, and `pg_stat_scan_tables` allow simplified permission configuration.",
        "Properly update the statistics collector during REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW (Jim Mlodgenski)",
        "Change the default value of log_line_prefix to include current timestamp (with milliseconds) and the process ID in each line of postmaster log output (Christoph Berg)\nThe previous default was an empty prefix.",
        "Add functions to return the log and WAL directory contents (Dave Page)\nThe new functions are `pg_ls_logdir()()` and `pg_ls_waldir()()` and can be executed by non-superusers with the proper permissions.",
        "Add function `pg_current_logfile()()` to read logging collector's current stderr and csvlog output file names (Gilles Darold)",
        "Report the address and port number of each listening socket in the server log during postmaster startup (Tom Lane)\nAlso, when logging failure to bind a listening socket, include the specific address we attempted to bind to.",
        "Reduce log chatter about the starting and stopping of launcher subprocesses (Tom Lane)\nThese are now `DEBUG1`-level messages.",
        "Reduce message verbosity of lower-numbered debug levels controlled by log_min_messages (Robert Haas)\nThis also changes the verbosity of client_min_messages debug levels.",
        "Add pg_stat_activity reporting of low-level wait states (Michael Paquier, Robert Haas, Rushabh Lathia)\nThis change enables reporting of numerous low-level wait conditions, including latch waits, file reads/writes/fsyncs, client reads/writes, and synchronous replication.",
        "Show auxiliary processes, background workers, and walsender processes in pg_stat_activity (Kuntal Ghosh, Michael Paquier)\nThis simplifies monitoring. A new column backend_type identifies the process type.",
        "Allow pg_stat_activity to show the SQL query being executed by parallel workers (Rafia Sabih)",
        "Rename pg_stat_activity.wait_event_type values `LWLockTranche` and `LWLockNamed` to `LWLock` (Robert Haas)\nThis makes the output more consistent.",
        "Change the password_encryption server parameter from boolean to enum (Michael Paquier)\nThis was necessary to support additional password hashing options.",
        "Add view pg_hba_file_rules to display the contents of pg_hba.conf (Haribabu Kommi)\nThis shows the file contents, not the currently active settings.",
        "Support multiple RADIUS servers (Magnus Hagander)\nAll the RADIUS related parameters are now plural and support a comma-separated list of servers.",
        "Allow SSL configuration to be updated during configuration reload (Andreas Karlsson, Tom Lane)\nThis allows SSL to be reconfigured without a server restart, by using pg_ctl reload, SELECT pg_reload_conf(), or sending a `SIGHUP` signal. However, reloading the SSL configuration does not work if the server's SSL key requires a passphrase, as there is no way to re-prompt for the passphrase. The original configuration will apply for the life of the postmaster in that case.",
        "Make the maximum value of bgwriter_lru_maxpages effectively unlimited (Jim Nasby)",
        "After creating or unlinking files, perform an fsync on their parent directory (Michael Paquier)\nThis reduces the risk of data loss after a power failure.",
        "Prevent unnecessary checkpoints and WAL archiving on otherwise-idle systems (Michael Paquier)",
        "Add wal_consistency_checking server parameter to add details to WAL that can be sanity-checked on the standby (Kuntal Ghosh, Robert Haas)\nAny sanity-check failure generates a fatal error on the standby.",
        "Increase the maximum configurable WAL segment size to one gigabyte (Beena Emerson)\nA larger WAL segment size allows for fewer archive_command invocations and fewer WAL files to manage.",
        "Add the ability to logically replicate tables to standby servers (Petr Jelinek)\nLogical replication allows more flexibility than physical replication does, including replication between different major versions of PostgreSQL and selective replication.",
        "Allow waiting for commit acknowledgment from standby servers irrespective of the order they appear in synchronous_standby_names (Masahiko Sawada)\nPreviously the server always waited for the active standbys that appeared first in synchronous_standby_names. The new synchronous_standby_names keyword `ANY` allows waiting for any number of standbys irrespective of their ordering. This is known as quorum commit.",
        "Reduce configuration changes necessary to perform streaming backup and replication (Magnus Hagander, Dang Minh Huong)\nSpecifically, the defaults were changed for wal_level, max_wal_senders, max_replication_slots, and hot_standby to make them suitable for these usages out-of-the-box.",
        "Enable replication from localhost connections by default in pg_hba.conf (Michael Paquier)\nPreviously pg_hba.conf's replication connection lines were commented out by default. This is particularly useful for pg_basebackup.",
        "Add columns to pg_stat_replication to report replication delay times (Thomas Munro)\nThe new columns are write_lag, flush_lag, and replay_lag.",
        "Allow specification of the recovery stopping point by Log Sequence Number (LSN) in recovery.conf (Michael Paquier)\nPreviously the stopping point could only be selected by timestamp or XID.",
        "Allow users to disable `pg_stop_backup()()`'s waiting for all WAL to be archived (David Steele)\nAn optional second argument to `pg_stop_backup()()` controls that behavior.",
        "Allow creation of temporary replication slots (Petr Jelinek)\nTemporary slots are automatically removed on session exit or error.",
        "Add `XMLTABLE()` function that converts XML-formatted data into a row set (Pavel Stehule, Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Fix regular expressions' character class handling for large character codes, particularly Unicode characters above `U+7FF` (Tom Lane)\nPreviously, such characters were never recognized as belonging to locale-dependent character classes such as `[[:alpha:]]`.",
        "Add table partitioning syntax that automatically creates partition constraints and handles routing of tuple insertions and updates (Amit Langote)\nThe syntax supports range and list partitioning.",
        "Add `AFTER` trigger transition tables to record changed rows (Kevin Grittner, Thomas Munro)\nTransition tables are accessible from triggers written in server-side languages.",
        "When creating a foreign-key constraint, check for `REFERENCES` permission on only the referenced table (Tom Lane)\nPreviously `REFERENCES` permission on the referencing table was also required. This appears to have stemmed from a misreading of the SQL standard. Since creating a foreign key (or any other type of) constraint requires ownership privilege on the constrained table, additionally requiring `REFERENCES` permission seems rather pointless.",
        "Allow default permissions on schemas (Matheus Oliveira)\nThis is done using the `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` command.",
        "Add CREATE SEQUENCE AS command to create a sequence matching an integer data type (Peter Eisentraut)\nThis simplifies the creation of sequences matching the range of base columns.",
        "Allow `COPY `view` FROM source` on views with `INSTEAD INSERT` triggers (Haribabu Kommi)\nThe triggers are fed the data rows read by COPY.",
        "Allow the specification of a function name without arguments in DDL commands, if it is unique (Peter Eisentraut)\nFor example, allow DROP FUNCTION on a function name without arguments if there is only one function with that name. This behavior is required by the SQL standard.",
        "Allow multiple functions, operators, and aggregates to be dropped with a single DROP command (Peter Eisentraut)",
        "Support `IF NOT EXISTS` in CREATE SERVER, CREATE USER MAPPING, and CREATE COLLATION (Anastasia Lubennikova, Peter Eisentraut)",
        "Make VACUUM VERBOSE report the number of skipped frozen pages and oldest xmin (Masahiko Sawada, Simon Riggs)\nThis information is also included in log_autovacuum_min_duration output.",
        "Add full text search support for JSON and JSONB (Dmitry Dolgov)\nThe functions `ts_headline()()` and `to_tsvector()()` can now be used on these data types.",
        "Add support for EUI-64 MAC addresses, as a new data type macaddr8 (Haribabu Kommi)\nThis complements the existing support for EUI-48 MAC addresses (type macaddr).",
        "Add identity columns for assigning a numeric value to columns on insert (Peter Eisentraut)\nThese are similar to SERIAL columns, but are SQL standard compliant.",
        "Allow ENUM values to be renamed (Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)\nThis uses the syntax ALTER TYPE ... RENAME VALUE.",
        "Properly treat array pseudotypes (anyarray) as arrays in `to_json()()` and `to_jsonb()()` (Andrew Dunstan)\nPreviously columns declared as anyarray (particularly those in the pg_stats view) were converted to JSON strings rather than arrays.",
        "Add operators for multiplication and division of money values with int8 values (Peter Eisentraut)\nPreviously such cases would result in converting the int8 values to float8 and then using the money-and-float8 operators. The new behavior avoids possible precision loss. But note that division of money by int8 now truncates the quotient, like other integer-division cases, while the previous behavior would have rounded.",
        "Check for overflow in the money type's input function (Peter Eisentraut)",
        "Add simplified `regexp_match()()` function (Emre Hasegeli)\nThis is similar to `regexp_matches()()`, but it only returns results from the first match so it does not need to return a set, making it easier to use for simple cases.",
        "Add a version of jsonb's delete operator that takes an array of keys to delete (Magnus Hagander)",
        "Make `json_populate_record()()` and related functions process JSON arrays and objects recursively (Nikita Glukhov)\nWith this change, array-type fields in the destination SQL type are properly converted from JSON arrays, and composite-type fields are properly converted from JSON objects. Previously, such cases would fail because the text representation of the JSON value would be fed to `array_in()()` or `record_in()()`, and its syntax would not match what those input functions expect.",
        "Add function `txid_current_if_assigned()()` to return the current transaction ID or `NULL` if no transaction ID has been assigned (Craig Ringer)\nThis is different from `txid_current()()`, which always returns a transaction ID, assigning one if necessary. Unlike that function, this function can be run on standby servers.",
        "Add function `txid_status()()` to check if a transaction was committed (Craig Ringer)\nThis is useful for checking after an abrupt disconnection whether your previous transaction committed and you just didn't receive the acknowledgment.",
        "Allow `make_date()()` to interpret negative years as BC years (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Make `to_timestamp()()` and `to_date()()` reject out-of-range input fields (Artur Zakirov)\nFor example, previously `to_date('2009-06-40','YYYY-MM-DD')` was accepted and returned `2009-07-10`. It will now generate an error.",
        "Allow PL/Python's `cursor()()` and `execute()()` functions to be called as methods of their plan-object arguments (Peter Eisentraut)\nThis allows a more object-oriented programming style.",
        "Allow PL/pgSQL's GET DIAGNOSTICS statement to retrieve values into array elements (Tom Lane)\nPreviously, a syntactic restriction prevented the target variable from being an array element.",
        "Allow PL/Tcl functions to return composite types and sets (Karl Lehenbauer)",
        "Add a subtransaction command to PL/Tcl (Victor Wagner)\nThis allows PL/Tcl queries to fail without aborting the entire function.",
        "Add server parameters pltcl.start_proc and pltclu.start_proc, to allow initialization functions to be called on PL/Tcl startup (Tom Lane)",
        "Allow specification of multiple host names or addresses in libpq connection strings and URIs (Robert Haas, Heikki Linnakangas)\nlibpq will connect to the first responsive server in the list.",
        "Allow libpq connection strings and URIs to request a read/write host, that is a master server rather than a standby server (Victor Wagner, Mithun Cy)\nThis is useful when multiple host names are specified. It is controlled by libpq connection parameter target_session_attrs.",
        "Allow the password file name to be specified as a libpq connection parameter (Julian Markwort)\nPreviously this could only be specified via an environment variable.",
        "Add function `PQencryptPasswordConn()()` to allow creation of more types of encrypted passwords on the client side (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas)\nPreviously only `MD5`-encrypted passwords could be created using `PQencryptPassword()()`. This new function can also create `SCRAM-SHA-256`-encrypted passwords.",
        "Change ecpg preprocessor version from 4.12 to 10 (Tom Lane)\nHenceforth the ecpg version will match the PostgreSQL distribution version number.",
        "Add conditional branch support to psql (Corey Huinker)\nThis feature adds psql meta-commands \\if, \\elif, \\else, and \\endif. This is primarily helpful for scripting.",
        "Add psql \\gx meta-command to execute (\\g) a query in expanded mode (\\x) (Christoph Berg)",
        "Expand psql variable references in backtick-executed strings (Tom Lane)\nThis is particularly useful in the new psql conditional branch commands.",
        "Prevent psql's special variables from being set to invalid values (Daniel Vérité, Tom Lane)\nPreviously, setting one of psql's special variables to an invalid value silently resulted in the default behavior. \\set on a special variable now fails if the proposed new value is invalid. As a special exception, \\set with an empty or omitted new value, on a boolean-valued special variable, still has the effect of setting the variable to `on`; but now it actually acquires that value rather than an empty string. \\unset on a special variable now explicitly sets the variable to its default value, which is also the value it acquires at startup. In sum, a control variable now always has a displayable value that reflects what psql is actually doing.",
        "Add variables showing server version and psql version (Fabien Coelho)",
        "Improve psql's \\d (display relation) and \\dD (display domain) commands to show collation, nullable, and default properties in separate columns (Peter Eisentraut)\nPreviously they were shown in a single “Modifiers” column.",
        "Make the various \\d commands handle no-matching-object cases more consistently (Daniel Gustafsson)\nThey now all print the message about that to stderr, not stdout, and the message wording is more consistent.",
        "Improve psql's tab completion (Jeff Janes, Ian Barwick, Andreas Karlsson, Sehrope Sarkuni, Thomas Munro, Kevin Grittner, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsåker)",
        "Add pgbench option --log-prefix to control the log file prefix (Masahiko Sawada)",
        "Allow pgbench's meta-commands to span multiple lines (Fabien Coelho)\nA meta-command can now be continued onto the next line by writing backslash-return.",
        "Remove restriction on placement of -M option relative to other command line options (Tom Lane)",

However, indirect drops (such as a cascade from dropping a key column's data type) had no such check, allowing the deletion of a key column. This resulted in a badly broken partitioned table that could neither be accessed nor dropped.\nThis fix adds pg_depend entries that enforce that the whole partitioned table, not just the key column, will be dropped if a cascaded drop forces removal of the key column. However, such entries will only be created when a partitioned table is created; so this fix does not remove the risk for pre-existing partitioned tables.

        "Fix ALTER SYSTEM to cope with duplicate entries in postgresql.auto.conf (Ian Barwick)\nALTER SYSTEM itself will not generate such a state, but external tools that modify postgresql.auto.conf could do so. Duplicate entries for the target variable will now be removed, and then the new setting (if any) will be appended at the end.",

        "Avoid logging complaints about abandoned connections when using PAM authentication (Tom Lane)\nlibpq-based clients will typically make two connection attempts when a password is required, since they don't prompt their user for a password until their first connection attempt fails. Therefore the server is coded not to generate useless log spam when a client closes the connection upon being asked for a password. However, the PAM authentication code hadn't gotten that memo, and would generate several messages about a phantom authentication failure.",
        "Fix some cases where an incomplete date specification is not detected in time with time zone input (Alexander Lakhin)\nIf a time zone with a time-varying UTC offset is specified, then a date must be as well, so that the offset can be resolved. Depending on the syntax used, this check was not enforced in some cases, allowing bogus output to be produced.",
        "Fix misbehavior of `bitshiftright()()` (Tom Lane)\nThe bitstring right shift operator failed to zero out padding space that exists in the last byte of the result when the bitstring length is not a multiple of 8. While invisible to most operations, any nonzero bits there would result in unexpected comparison behavior, since bitstring comparisons don't bother to ignore the extra bits, expecting them to always be zero.\nIf you have inconsistent data as a result of saving the output of `bitshiftright()()` in a table, it's possible to fix it with something like\nUPDATE mytab SET bitcol = ~(~bitcol) WHERE bitcol != ~(~bitcol);",

One step in the logic was out of sync with that, and might try to write the value into a 6-byte buffer. In principle this could cause a stack overrun, but on most architectures it's likely that the next byte would be unused alignment padding, making the bug harmless. In any case the bug would be very difficult to hit.",
        "Fix handling of infinity, NaN, and NULL values in KNN-GiST (Alexander Korotkov)\nThe query's output order could be wrong (different from a plain sort's result) if some distances computed for non-null column values are infinity or NaN.",

Some of the risks here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.) Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is a hazard to consider. (CVE-2020-14349)",

Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege. To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib modules to ensure they are secure. Also provide documentation to help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure.

This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\nWhen applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

        "Provide for forward compatibility with future minor protocol versions (Robert Haas, Badrul Chowdhury)\nUp to now, PostgreSQL servers simply rejected requests to use protocol versions newer than 3.0, so that there was no functional difference between the major and minor parts of the protocol version number.

This makes no difference at the moment, but back-patching this change should allow speedier introduction of future minor protocol upgrades."

Make it start with the object type instead, bringing ACLs into line with the convention already used for comment and security label archive entries. Also, fix the comment and security label entries for the whole database, if present, to make their tags start with `DATABASE` so that they also follow this convention. This prevents false matches in code that tries to identify large-object-related entries by seeing if the tag starts with `LARGE OBJECT`. That could have resulted in misclassifying entries as data rather than schema, with undesirable results in a schema-only or data-only dump.\nNote that this change has user-visible results in the output of pg_restore --list."

In typical usage on multi-user machines, the `umask` and/or the working directory's permissions would be tight enough to prevent problems; but there may be people using pg_upgrade in scenarios where this oversight would permit disclosure of database passwords to unfriendly eyes.

This prevents a form of trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise future uses of the object by other users. As a side benefit, it also reduces the risk of accidentally replacing objects one did not mean to.\nThe PostgreSQL Project thanks Sven Klemm for reporting this problem. (CVE-2022-2625)",

Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis.

America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\nThese zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\nIt is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

Servers allowing peer authentication on local connections are particularly vulnerable. Other attacks such as SQL injection into a postgres_fdw session are also possible. Attacking postgres_fdw in this way requires the ability to create a foreign server object with selected connection parameters, but any user with access to dblink could exploit the problem. In general, an attacker with the ability to select the connection parameters for a libpq-using application could cause mischief, though other plausible attack scenarios are harder to think of.

        "By default, panic instead of retrying after `fsync()()` failure, to avoid possible data corruption (Craig Ringer, Thomas Munro)\nSome popular operating systems discard kernel data buffers when unable to write them out, reporting this as `fsync()()` failure. If we reissue the `fsync()()` request it will succeed, but in fact the data has been lost, so continuing risks database corruption. By raising a panic condition instead, we can replay from WAL, which may contain the only remaining copy of the data in such a situation. While this is surely ugly and inefficient, there are few alternatives, and fortunately the case happens very rarely.\nA new server parameter data_sync_retry has been added to control this; if you are certain that your kernel does not discard dirty data buffers in such scenarios, you can set data_sync_retry to `on` to restore the old behavior."

In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed to consider the effects of row-level security. A user who has SQL permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows' contents via a leaky operator.

Now pg_dump --create and pg_restore --create will restore these database properties in addition to the objects within the database. pg_dumpall -g now only dumps role- and tablespace-related attributes. pg_dumpall's complete output (without -g) is unchanged.\n          pg_dump and pg_restore, without --create, no longer dump/restore database-level comments and security labels; those are now treated as properties of the database.\n          pg_dumpall's output script will now always create databases with their original locale and encoding, and hence will fail if the locale or encoding name is unknown to the destination system. Previously, CREATE DATABASE would be emitted without these specifications if the database locale and encoding matched the old cluster's defaults.\n          pg_dumpall --clean now restores the original locale and encoding settings of the `postgres` and `template1` databases, as well as those of user-created databases.",

Add `GROUPS` mode to include plus or minus the number of peer groups. Frame exclusion syntax was also added.",

        "Consider syntactic form when disambiguating function versus column references (Tom Lane)\n          When `x` is a table name or composite column, PostgreSQL has traditionally considered the syntactic forms ``f`(x`) and ``x`.f` to be equivalent, allowing tricks such as writing a function and then using it as though it were a computed-on-demand column. However, if both interpretations are feasible, the column interpretation was always chosen, leading to surprising results if the user intended the function interpretation. Now, if there is ambiguity, the interpretation that matches the syntactic form is chosen.",
        "Fully enforce uniqueness of table and domain constraint names (Tom Lane)\n          PostgreSQL expects the names of a table's constraints to be distinct, and likewise for the names of a domain's constraints. However, there was not rigid enforcement of this, and previously there were corner cases where duplicate names could be created.",
        "Make `power(numeric, numeric)()` and `power(float8, float8)()` handle `NaN` inputs according to the POSIX standard (Tom Lane, Dang Minh Huong)\n          POSIX says that `NaN ^ 0 = 1` and `1 ^ NaN = 1`, but all other cases with `NaN` input(s) should return `NaN`. `power(numeric, numeric)()` just returned `NaN` in all such cases; now it honors the two exceptions. `power(float8, float8)()` followed the standard if the C library does; but on some old Unix platforms the library doesn't, and there were also problems on some versions of Windows.",
        "Prevent `to_number()()` from consuming characters when the template separator does not match (Oliver Ford)\n          Specifically, SELECT to_number('1234', '9,999') used to return `134`. It will now return `1234`. `L` and `TH` now only consume characters that are not digits, positive/negative signs, decimal points, or commas.",
        "Fix `to_date()()`, `to_number()()`, and `to_timestamp()()` to skip a character for each template character (Tom Lane)\n          Previously, they skipped one byte for each byte of template character, resulting in strange behavior if either string contained multibyte characters.",
        "Adjust the handling of backslashes inside double-quotes in template strings for `to_char()()`, `to_number()()`, and `to_timestamp()()`.\n          Such a backslash now escapes the character after it, particularly a double-quote or another backslash.",
        "Correctly handle relative path expressions in `xmltable()()`, `xpath()()`, and other XML-handling functions (Markus Winand)\n          Per the SQL standard, relative paths start from the document node of the XML input document, not the root node as these functions previously did.",

        "Prevent non-superusers from reindexing shared catalogs (Michael Paquier, Robert Haas)\n          Previously, database owners were also allowed to do this, but now it is considered outside the bounds of their privileges.",
        "Remove deprecated adminpack functions `pg_file_read()()`, `pg_file_length()()`, and `pg_logfile_rotate()()` (Stephen Frost)\n          Equivalent functionality is now present in the core backend. Existing adminpack installs will continue to have access to these functions until they are updated via ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE.",
        "Honor the capitalization of double-quoted command options (Daniel Gustafsson)\n          Previously, option names in certain SQL commands were forcibly lower-cased even if entered with double quotes; thus for example `\"FillFactor\"` would be accepted as an index storage option, though properly its name is lower-case. Such cases will now generate an error.",

        "Allow the creation of partitions based on hashing a key column (Amul Sul)",
        "Support indexes on partitioned tables (Álvaro Herrera, Amit Langote)\n              An “index” on a partitioned table is not a physical index across the whole partitioned table, but rather a template for automatically creating similar indexes on each partition of the table.\n              If the partition key is part of the index's column set, a partitioned index may be declared `UNIQUE`. It will represent a valid uniqueness constraint across the whole partitioned table, even though each physical index only enforces uniqueness within its own partition.\n              The new command ALTER INDEX ATTACH PARTITION causes an existing index on a partition to be associated with a matching index template for its partitioned table. This provides flexibility in setting up a new partitioned index for an existing partitioned table.",
        "Allow foreign keys on partitioned tables (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Allow `FOR EACH ROW` triggers on partitioned tables (Álvaro Herrera)\n              Creation of a trigger on a partitioned table automatically creates triggers on all existing and future partitions. This also allows deferred unique constraints on partitioned tables.",
        "Allow partitioned tables to have a default partition (Jeevan Ladhe, Beena Emerson, Ashutosh Bapat, Rahila Syed, Robert Haas)\n              The default partition will store rows that don't match any of the other defined partitions, and is searched accordingly.",
        "UPDATE statements that change a partition key column now cause affected rows to be moved to the appropriate partitions (Amit Khandekar)",
        "Allow INSERT, UPDATE, and COPY on partitioned tables to properly route rows to foreign partitions (Etsuro Fujita, Amit Langote)\n              This is supported by postgres_fdw foreign tables. Since the `ExecForeignInsert()` callback function is called for this in a different way than it used to be, foreign data wrappers must be modified to cope with this change.",
        "Allow partition elimination during query execution (David Rowley, Beena Emerson)\n              Previously, partition elimination only happened at planning time, meaning many joins and prepared queries could not use partition elimination.",
        "In an equality join between partitioned tables, allow matching partitions to be joined directly (Ashutosh Bapat)\n              This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled by changing enable_partitionwise_join.",
        "Allow aggregate functions on partitioned tables to be evaluated separately for each partition, subsequently merging the results (Jeevan Chalke, Ashutosh Bapat, Robert Haas)\n              This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled by changing enable_partitionwise_aggregate.",
        "Allow postgres_fdw to push down aggregates to foreign tables that are partitions (Jeevan Chalke)",

        "Allow partition scans to more efficiently use parallel workers (Amit Khandekar, Robert Haas, Amul Sul)",
        "Allow `LIMIT` to be passed to parallel workers (Robert Haas, Tom Lane)\n              This allows workers to reduce returned results and use targeted index scans.",
        "Allow single-evaluation queries, e.g., `WHERE` clause aggregate queries, and functions in the target list to be parallelized (Amit Kapila, Robert Haas)",
        "Add server parameter parallel_leader_participation to control whether the leader also executes subplans (Thomas Munro)\n              The default is enabled, meaning the leader will execute subplans.",
        "Allow parallelization of commands CREATE TABLE ... AS, SELECT INTO, and CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW (Haribabu Kommi)",
        "Add reporting of parallel workers' sort activity in EXPLAIN (Robert Haas, Tom Lane)",
        "Allow B-tree indexes to include columns that are not part of the search key or unique constraint, but are available to be read by index-only scans (Anastasia Lubennikova, Alexander Korotkov, Teodor Sigaev)\n              This is enabled by the new `INCLUDE` clause of CREATE INDEX. It facilitates building “covering indexes” that optimize specific types of queries. Columns can be included even if their data types don't have B-tree support.",
        "Add predicate locking for hash, GiST and GIN indexes (Shubham Barai)\n              This reduces the likelihood of serialization conflicts in serializable-mode transactions.",
        "Add prefix-match operator text `^@` text, which is supported by SP-GiST (Ildus Kurbangaliev)\n                This is similar to using `var` `LIKE 'word%'` with a btree index, but it is more efficient.",
        "Allow polygons to be indexed with SP-GiST (Nikita Glukhov, Alexander Korotkov)",
        "Allow SP-GiST to use lossy representation of leaf keys (Teodor Sigaev, Heikki Linnakangas, Alexander Korotkov, Nikita Glukhov)",
        "Improve selection of the most common values for statistics (Jeff Janes, Dean Rasheed)\n              Previously, the most common values (MCVs) were identified based on their frequency compared to all column values. Now, MCVs are chosen based on their frequency compared to the non-MCV values. This improves the robustness of the algorithm for both uniform and non-uniform distributions.",
        "Improve selectivity estimates for `&gt;=` and `&lt;=` (Tom Lane)\n              Previously, such cases used the same selectivity estimates as `&gt;` and `&lt;`, respectively, unless the comparison constants are MCVs. This change is particularly helpful for queries involving `BETWEEN` with small ranges.",
        "Reduce `var` `=` `var` to `var` `IS NOT NULL` where equivalent (Tom Lane)\n              This leads to better selectivity estimates.",

These roles now also control who can use server-side COPY and the file_fdw extension. Previously, only superusers could use these functions, and that is still the default behavior.",
        "Allow access to file system functions to be controlled by GRANT/REVOKE permissions, rather than superuser checks (Stephen Frost)\n              Specifically, these functions were modified: `pg_ls_dir()()`, `pg_read_file()()`, `pg_read_binary_file()()`, `pg_stat_file()()`.",
        "Use GRANT/REVOKE to control access to `lo_import()()` and `lo_export()()` (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)\n              Previously, only superusers were granted access to these functions.\n              The compile-time option `ALLOW_DANGEROUS_LO_FUNCTIONS` has been removed.",

        "Fix CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to wait for concurrent prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)\n          At the point where CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY waits for all concurrent transactions to complete so that it can see rows they inserted, it must also wait for all prepared transactions to complete, for the same reason. Its failure to do so meant that rows inserted by prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. In installations that have enabled prepared transactions (max_prepared_transactions &gt; 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",

No issue could arise unless an installation had gotten to within one page of SLRU overflow, which is unlikely in a properly-functioning system.

This was particularly a problem with log_nested_statements enabled.",

        "Make contrib/pg_prewarm more robust when the cluster is shut down before prewarming is complete (Tom Lane)\n          Previously, autoprewarm would rewrite its status file with only the block numbers that it had managed to load so far, thus perhaps largely disabling the prewarm functionality in the next startup. Instead, suppress status file updates until the initial loading pass is complete.",
        "In contrib/pg_trgm's GiST index support, avoid crash in the rare case that picksplit is called on exactly two index items (Andrew Gierth, Alexander Korotkov)",

When waiting for a result from a remote server, contrib/postgres_fdw overestimated the desired timeout by a factor of 1000 (though this error had been mitigated by imposing a clamp to 60 seconds).\n          Both of these errors stemmed from incorrectly converting seconds-and-microseconds to milliseconds. Introduce a new API `TimestampDifferenceMilliseconds()()` to make it easier to get this right in the future.",

That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n          In addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism.

No error is observed unless the UPDATE involves other tables being joined to the target table. (CVE-2021-32029)",

After updating to this version, any misbehaving partitioned tables can be fixed by executing a new ALTER command to set the desired properties.\n          This change also disallows applying such an ALTER directly to the constraints of leaf partitions.

        "Prevent data loss during crash recovery of CREATE TABLESPACE, when wal_level = `minimal` (Noah Misch)\n          If the server crashed between CREATE TABLESPACE and the next checkpoint, replay would fully remove the contents of the new tablespace's directory, relying on subsequent WAL replay to restore everything within that directory. This interacts badly with optimizations that skip writing WAL (one example is COPY into a just-created table). Such optimizations are applied only when wal_level is `minimal`, which is not the default in v10 and later.",

We were using a mapping table that we'd generated years ago and updated only fitfully; unsurprisingly, it contained a number of errors as well as omissions of recently-added zones.

        "Make the server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS encryption handshake (Tom Lane)\n          A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a supposedly encryption-protected database session. This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although that would only work if the server did not demand any authentication data. (However, a server relying on SSL certificate authentication might well not do so.)\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting this problem. (CVE-2021-23214)",

This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's behavior make that harder than it sounds. A different line of attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive data that might be sent early in the session. That has been shown to be possible with a server vulnerable to CVE-2021-23214.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Jacob Champion for reporting this problem. (CVE-2021-23222)",
        "Fix physical replication for cases where the primary crashes after shipping a WAL segment that ends with a partial WAL record (Álvaro Herrera)\n          If the primary did not survive long enough to finish writing the rest of the incomplete WAL record, then the previous crash-recovery logic had it back up and overwrite WAL starting from the beginning of the incomplete WAL record. This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n          When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",
        "Fix CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to wait for the latest prepared transactions (Andrey Borodin)\n          Rows inserted by just-prepared transactions might be omitted from the new index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows. The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for PREPARE TRANSACTION commands that were still in progress when CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY checked for them. As before, in installations that have enabled prepared transactions (max_prepared_transactions &gt; 0), it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in case this problem occurred when they were built.",
        "Avoid race condition that can cause backends to fail to add entries for new rows to an index being built concurrently (Noah Misch, Andrey Borodin)\n          While it's apparently rare in the field, this case could potentially affect any index built or reindexed with the `CONCURRENTLY` option. It is recommended to reindex any such indexes to make sure they are correct.",
        "Fix float4 and float8 hash functions to produce uniform results for NaNs (Tom Lane)\n          Since PostgreSQL's floating-point types deem all NaNs to be equal, it's important for the hash functions to produce the same hash code for all bit-patterns that are NaNs according to the IEEE 754 standard. This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values. (`'-NaN'::float8` is one way to produce such a value on most machines.) It is advisable to reindex hash indexes on floating-point columns, if there is any possibility that they might contain such values.",
        "Ensure that the relation cache is invalidated for a table being attached to or detached from a partitioned table (Amit Langote, Álvaro Herrera)\n          This oversight could allow misbehavior of subsequent inserts/updates addressed directly to the partition, but only in currently-existing sessions.",

        "Don't discard a cast to the same type with unspecified type modifier (Tom Lane)\n          For example, if column `f1` is of type `numeric(18,3)`, the parser used to simply discard a cast like `f1::numeric`, on the grounds that it would have no run-time effect. That's true, but the exposed type of the expression should still be considered to be plain `numeric`, not `numeric(18,3)`. This is important for correctly resolving the type of larger constructs, such as recursive `UNION`s.",
        "Fix updates of element fields in arrays of domain over composite (Tom Lane)\n          A command such as `UPDATE tab SET fld[1].subfld = val` failed if the array's elements were domains rather than plain composites.",
        "Disallow creating an ICU collation if the current database's encoding won't support it (Tom Lane)\n          Previously this was allowed, but then the collation could not be referenced because of the way collation lookup works; you could not use the collation, nor even drop it.",

        "Avoid regular expression errors with capturing parentheses inside `{0}` (Tom Lane)\n          Regular expressions like `(.){0}...\\1` drew “invalid backreference number”. Other regexp engines such as Perl don't complain, though, and for that matter ours doesn't either in some closely related cases. Worse, it could throw an assertion failure instead. Fix it so that no error is thrown and instead the back-reference is silently deemed to never match.",
        "Prevent regular expression back-references from sometimes matching when they shouldn't (Tom Lane)\n          The regexp engine was careless about clearing match data for capturing parentheses after rejecting a partial match. This could allow a later back-reference to match in places where it should fail for lack of a defined referent.",
        "Fix incorrect results from `AT TIME ZONE` applied to a time with time zone value (Tom Lane)\n          The results were incorrect if the target time zone was specified by a dynamic timezone abbreviation (that is, one that is defined as equivalent to a full time zone name, rather than a fixed UTC offset).",
        "Avoid using MCV-only statistics to estimate the range of a column (Tom Lane)\n          There are corner cases in which ANALYZE will build a most-common-values (MCV) list but not a histogram, even though the MCV list does not account for all the observed values. In such cases, keep the planner from using the MCV list alone to estimate the range of column values.",
        "Fix restoration of a Portal's snapshot inside a subtransaction (Bertrand Drouvot)\n          If a procedure commits or rolls back a transaction, and then its next significant action is inside a new subtransaction, snapshot management went wrong, leading to a dangling pointer and probable crash. A typical example in PL/pgSQL is a `COMMIT` immediately followed by a `BEGIN ... EXCEPTION` block that performs a query.",
        "Clean up correctly if a transaction fails after exporting its snapshot (Dilip Kumar)\n          This oversight would only cause a problem if the same session attempted to export a snapshot again.

If that session then used the snapshot to perform data updates, erroneous results or data corruption could occur.",
        "Refuse to rewind a cursor marked `NO SCROLL` if it has been held over from a previous transaction due to the `WITH HOLD` option (Tom Lane)\n          We have long forbidden fetching backwards from a `NO SCROLL` cursor, but for historical reasons the prohibition didn't extend to cases in which we rewind the query altogether and then re-fetch forwards. That exception leads to inconsistencies, particularly for held-over cursors which may not have stored all the data necessary to rewind. Disallow rewinding for non-scrollable held-over cursors to block the worst inconsistencies. (v15 will remove the exception altogether.)",

        "Correctly track the presence of data-modifying CTEs when expanding a `DO INSTEAD` rule (Greg Nancarrow, Tom Lane)\n          The previous failure to do this could lead to problems such as unsafely choosing a parallel plan.",

        "Fix incorrect snapshot handling in parallel workers (Greg Nancarrow)\n          This oversight could lead to misbehavior in parallel queries if the transaction isolation level is less than `REPEATABLE READ`.",
        "Fix logical decoding to correctly ignore toast-table changes for transient tables (Bertrand Drouvot)\n          Logical decoding normally ignores changes in transient tables such as those created during an ALTER TABLE heap rewrite. But that filtering wasn't applied to the associated toast table if any, leading to possible errors when rewriting a table that's being published.",
        "Ensure that walreceiver processes create all required archive notification files before exiting (Fujii Masao)\n          If a walreceiver exited exactly at a WAL segment boundary, it failed to make a notification file for the last-received segment, thus delaying archiving of that segment on the standby.",

If the `FILTER` expression is itself a boolean-returning aggregate, an error should be thrown but was not, likely resulting in a crash at execution.",

        "Make pg_dump acquire shared lock on partitioned tables that are to be dumped (Tom Lane)\n          This oversight was usually pretty harmless, since once pg_dump has locked any of the leaf partitions, that would suffice to prevent significant DDL on the partitioned table itself.

        "Fix index-only scan plans for cases where not all index columns can be returned (Tom Lane)\n          If an index has both returnable and non-returnable columns, and one of the non-returnable columns is an expression using a table column that appears in a returnable index column, then a query using that expression could result in an index-only scan plan that attempts to read the non-returnable column, instead of recomputing the expression from the returnable column as intended. The non-returnable column would read as NULL, resulting in wrong query results.",
        "Ensure that casting to an unspecified typmod generates a RelabelType node rather than a length-coercion function call (Tom Lane)\n          While the coercion function should do the right thing (nothing), this translation is undesirably inefficient.",
        "Fix WAL replay failure when database consistency is reached exactly at a WAL page boundary (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Fix startup of a physical replica to tolerate transaction ID wraparound (Abhijit Menon-Sen, Tomas Vondra)\n          If a replica server is started while the set of active transactions on the primary crosses a wraparound boundary (so that there are some newer transactions with smaller XIDs than older ones), the replica would fail with “out-of-order XID insertion in KnownAssignedXids”. The replica would retry, but could never get past that error.",
        "Remove lexical limitations for SQL commands issued on a logical replication connection (Tom Lane)\n          The walsender process would fail for a SQL command containing an unquoted semicolon, or with dollar-quoted literals containing odd numbers of single or double quote marks, or when the SQL command starts with a comment. Moreover, faulty error recovery could lead to unexpected errors in later commands too.",

        "Build extended statistics for partitioned tables (Justin Pryzby)\n          A previous bug fix disabled building of extended statistics for old-style inheritance trees, but it also prevented building them for partitioned tables, which was an unnecessary restriction. This change allows ANALYZE to compute values for statistics objects for partitioned tables. (But note that autovacuum does not process partitioned tables as such, so you must periodically issue manual ANALYZE on the partitioned table if you want to maintain such statistics.)",
        "Ignore extended statistics for inheritance trees (Justin Pryzby)\n          Currently, extended statistics values are only computed locally for each table, not for entire inheritance trees. However the values were mistakenly consulted when planning queries across inheritance trees, possibly resulting in worse-than-default estimates.",
        "Disallow altering data type of a partitioned table's columns when the partitioned table's row type is used as a composite type elsewhere (Tom Lane)\n          This restriction has long existed for regular tables, but through an oversight it was not checked for partitioned tables.",

        "Avoid leaking memory during REASSIGN OWNED BY operations that reassign ownership of many objects (Justin Pryzby)",
        "Fix display of whole-row variables appearing in `INSERT ... VALUES` rules (Tom Lane)\n          A whole-row variable would be printed as “var.*”, but that allows it to be expanded to individual columns when the rule is reloaded, resulting in different semantics. Attach an explicit cast to prevent that, as we do elsewhere.",

        "Avoid calling `strerror()` from libpq's `PQcancel()` function (Tom Lane)\n          `PQcancel()` is supposed to be safe to call from a signal handler, but `strerror()` is not safe. The faulty usage only occurred in the unlikely event of failure to send the cancel message to the server, perhaps explaining the lack of reports.",
        "Make psql's \\password command default to setting the password for `CURRENT_USER`, not the connection's original user name (Tom Lane)\n          This agrees with the documented behavior, and avoids probable permissions failure if SET ROLE or SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION has been done since the session began. To prevent confusion, the role name to be acted on is now included in the password prompt.",
        "In psql and some other client programs, avoid trying to invoke `gettext()()` from a control-C signal handler (Tom Lane)\n          While no reported failures have been traced to this mistake, it seems highly unlikely to be a safe thing to do.",

        "Fix possible mis-reporting of errors in pg_dump and pg_basebackup (Tom Lane)\n          The previous code failed to check for errors from some kernel calls, and could report the wrong errno values in other cases.",
        "Fix results of index-only scans on contrib/btree_gist indexes on char(`N`) columns (Tom Lane)\n          Index-only scans returned column values with trailing spaces removed, which is not the expected behavior. That happened because that's how the data was stored in the index. This fix changes the code to store char(`N`) values with the expected amount of space padding. The behavior of such an index will not change immediately unless you REINDEX it; otherwise space-stripped values will be gradually replaced over time during updates. Queries that do not use index-only scan plans will be unaffected in any case.",
        "Change configure to use Python's sysconfig module, rather than the deprecated distutils module, to determine how to build PL/Python (Peter Eisentraut, Tom Lane, Andres Freund)\n          With Python 3.10, this avoids configure-time warnings about distutils being deprecated and scheduled for removal in Python 3.12. Presumably, once 3.12 is out, `configure --with-python` would fail altogether. This future-proofing does come at a cost: sysconfig did not exist before Python 2.7, nor before 3.2 in the Python 3 branch, so it is no longer possible to build PL/Python against long-dead Python versions.",

A user having permission to create non-temporary objects within a database could define an object that would execute arbitrary SQL code with superuser permissions the next time that autovacuum processed the object, or that some superuser ran one of the affected commands against it.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Alexander Lakhin for reporting this problem.

However, it's not okay for such code to try to invoke SQL operations via SPI. That results in a crash, and if it didn't crash it would be a security hazard, because we really don't want code execution during function validation.

        "Stop using query-provided column aliases for the columns of whole-row variables that refer to plain tables (Tom Lane)\n          The column names in tuples produced by a whole-row variable (such as `tbl.*` in contexts other than the top level of a `SELECT` list) are now always those of the associated named composite type, if there is one. We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n          In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type record to begin with and there's no issue.",

        "Fix risk of deadlock failures while dropping a partitioned index (Jimmy Yih, Gaurab Dey, Tom Lane)\n          Ensure that the required table and index locks are taken in the standard order (parents before children, tables before indexes). The previous coding for DROP INDEX did it differently, and so could deadlock against concurrent queries taking these locks in the standard order.",
        "Fix race condition between DROP TABLESPACE and checkpointing (Nathan Bossart)\n          The checkpoint forced by DROP TABLESPACE could sometimes fail to remove all dead files from the tablespace's directory, leading to a bogus “tablespace is not empty” error.",
        "Fix possible trouble in crash recovery after a TRUNCATE command that overlaps a checkpoint (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Heikki Linnakangas, Robert Haas)\n          TRUNCATE must ensure that the table's disk file is truncated before the checkpoint is allowed to complete. Otherwise, replay starting from that checkpoint might find unexpected data in the supposedly-removed pages, possibly causing replay failure.",

Namely, in addition to the current rules, allow the case where the key file is owned by root and has permissions `rw-r-----` or less. This is helpful for system-wide management of key files.",

If the postmaster died uncleanly without having removed its PID file or updated the control file, pg_ctl would wait until timeout. Instead make it recheck every so often that the postmaster process is still there.",

This prevents a form of trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise future uses of the object by other users.

This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued COMMIT but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()()` as a no-op. All known callers of `SPI_commit()()` immediately call `SPI_start_transaction()()`, so they will not notice any change. Similar remarks apply to `SPI_rollback()()`.\n          Also fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all, resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter.

Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n          These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n          It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Prevent row-level security policies from being bypassed via selectivity estimators (Dean Rasheed)\n          Some of the planner's selectivity estimators apply user-defined operators to values found in pg_statistic (e.g., most-common values). A leaky operator therefore can disclose some of the entries in a data column, even if the calling user lacks permission to read that column. In CVE-2017-7484 we added restrictions to forestall that, but we failed to consider the effects of row-level security. A user who has SQL permission to read a column, but who is forbidden to see certain rows due to RLS policy, might still learn something about those rows' contents via a leaky operator. This patch further tightens the rules, allowing leaky operators to be applied to statistics data only when there is no relevant RLS policy. (CVE-2019-10130)",

Require this as well for casting to temporary types using functional notation, for example `pg_temp.`type_name`(arg`). Otherwise it's possible to capture a function call using a temporary object, allowing privilege escalation in much the same ways that we blocked in CVE-2007-2138. (CVE-2019-10208)",
        "Fix execution of hashed subplans that require cross-type comparison (Tom Lane, Andreas Seltenreich)\n          Hashed subplans used the outer query's original comparison operator to compare entries of the hash table. This is the wrong thing if that operator is cross-type, since all the hash table entries will be of the subquery's output type. For the set of hashable cross-type operators in core PostgreSQL, this mistake seems nearly harmless on 64-bit machines, but it can result in crashes or perhaps unauthorized disclosure of server memory on 32-bit machines. Extensions might provide hashable cross-type operators that create larger risks. (CVE-2019-10209)",

However, indirect drops (such as a cascade from dropping a key column's data type) had no such check, allowing the deletion of a key column. This resulted in a badly broken partitioned table that could neither be accessed nor dropped.\n          This fix adds pg_depend entries that enforce that the whole partitioned table, not just the key column, will be dropped if a cascaded drop forces removal of the key column. However, such entries will only be created when a partitioned table is created; so this fix does not remove the risk for pre-existing partitioned tables. The issue can only arise for partition key columns of non-built-in data types, so it seems not to be a hazard for most users.",

This is unfortunate: it means that the query performance is likely worse than a plain sequential scan would be.\n          Applications whose performance is adversely impacted by this change have a couple of options. They could switch to a GIN index, which doesn't have this bug, or they could replace ``array_column` &lt;@ constant_array` with ``array_column` &lt;@ constant_array` AND `array_column` &amp;&amp; `constant_array`.

Some of the risks here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.)

Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege. To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib modules to ensure they are secure.

However, the range check was miscoded so that it would accept “23:59:60.`nnn`” with nonzero fractional-second `nnn`.

The main place that depends on that marking being correct is JIT-enabled tuple deconstruction, so teach it to explicitly ignore the marking for these two columns. Also adjust some C code that accessed srsublsn without checking to see if it's null; a crash from that is improbable but perhaps not impossible.",
        "Cope with `LATERAL` references in restriction clauses attached to an un-flattened sub-`SELECT` in the `FROM` clause (Tom Lane)\n          This oversight could result in assertion failures or crashes at query execution.",
        "Avoid believing that a never-analyzed foreign table has zero tuples (Tom Lane)\n          This primarily affected the planner's estimate of the number of groups that would be obtained by `GROUP BY`.",
        "Remove bogus warning about “leftover placeholder tuple” in BRIN index de-summarization (Álvaro Herrera)\n          The case can occur legitimately after a cancelled vacuum, so warning about it is overly noisy.",
        "Fix selection of tablespaces for “shared fileset” temporary files (Magnus Hagander, Tom Lane)\n          If temp_tablespaces is empty or explicitly names the database's primary tablespace, such files got placed into the `pg_default` tablespace rather than the database's primary tablespace as expected.",
        "Fix corner-case error in masking of SP-GiST index pages during WAL consistency checking (Alexander Korotkov)\n          This could cause false failure reports when wal_consistency_checking is enabled.",
        "Improve error handling in the server's buffile module (Thomas Munro)\n          Fix some cases where I/O errors were indistinguishable from reaching EOF, or were not reported at all. Also add details such as block numbers and byte counts where appropriate.",
        "Fix conflict-checking anomalies in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation mode (Peter Geoghegan)\n          If a concurrently-inserted tuple was updated by a different concurrent transaction, and neither tuple version was visible to the current transaction's snapshot, serialization conflict checking could draw the wrong conclusions about whether the tuple was relevant to the results of the current transaction. This could allow a serializable transaction to commit when it should have failed with a serialization error.",

        "Fix failure of some code paths to acquire the correct lock before modifying pg_control (Nathan Bossart, Fujii Masao)\n          This oversight could allow pg_control to be written out with an inconsistent checksum, possibly causing trouble later, including inability to restart the database if it crashed before the next pg_control update.",
        "Fix errors in `currtid()()` and `currtid2()()` (Michael Paquier)\n          These functions (which are undocumented and used only by ancient versions of the ODBC driver) contained coding errors that could result in crashes, or in confusing error messages such as “could not open file” when applied to a relation having no storage.",
        "Avoid calling `elog()()` or `palloc()()` while holding a spinlock (Michael Paquier, Tom Lane)\n          Logic associated with replication slots had several violations of this coding rule. While the odds of trouble are quite low, an error in the called function would lead to a stuck spinlock.",
        "Fix assertion in logical replication subscriber to allow use of `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` (Euler Taveira)\n          This was just an incorrect assertion, so it has no impact on standard production builds.",
        "Report out-of-disk-space errors properly in pg_dump and pg_basebackup (Justin Pryzby, Tom Lane, Álvaro Herrera)\n          Some code paths could produce silly reports like “could not write file: Success”.",
        "Fix parallel restore of tables having both table-level privileges and per-column privileges (Tom Lane)\n          The table-level privilege grants have to be applied first, but a parallel restore did not reliably order them that way; this could lead to “tuple concurrently updated” errors, or to disappearance of some per-column privilege grants. The fix for this is to include dependency links between such entries in the archive file, meaning that a new dump has to be taken with a corrected pg_dump to ensure that the problem will not recur.",
        "Ensure that pg_upgrade runs with vacuum_defer_cleanup_age set to zero in the target cluster (Bruce Momjian)\n          If the target cluster's configuration has been modified to set vacuum_defer_cleanup_age to a nonzero value, that prevented freezing of the system catalogs from working properly, which caused the upgrade to fail in confusing ways. Ensure that any such setting is overridden for the duration of the upgrade.",
        "Fix pg_recvlogical to drain pending messages before exiting (Noah Misch)\n          Without this, the replication sender might detect a send failure and exit without making the expected final update to the replication slot's LSN position. That led to re-transmitting data after the next connection. It was also possible to miss error messages sent after the last data that pg_recvlogical wants to consume.",
        "Fix pg_rewind's handling of just-deleted files in the source data directory (Justin Pryzby, Michael Paquier)\n          When working with an on-line source database, concurrent file deletions are possible, but pg_rewind would get confused if deletion happened between seeing a file's directory entry and examining it with `stat()()`.",
        "Make pg_test_fsync use binary I/O mode on Windows (Michael Paquier)\n          Previously it wrote the test file in text mode, which is not an accurate reflection of PostgreSQL's actual usage.",

        "Fix contrib/pgcrypto's misuse of `deflate()()` (Tom Lane)\n          The `pgp_sym_encrypt()` functions could produce incorrect compressed data due to mishandling of zlib's API requirements. We have no reports of this error manifesting with stock zlib, but it can be seen when using IBM's zlibNX implementation.",
        "Fix corner case in decompression logic in contrib/pgcrypto's `pgp_sym_decrypt()` functions (Kyotaro Horiguchi, Michael Paquier)\n          A compressed stream can validly end with an empty packet, but the decompressor failed to handle this and would complain about corrupt data.",

        "Improve performance by using a new algorithm for output of real and double precision values (Andrew Gierth)\n          Previously, displayed floating-point values were rounded to 6 (for real) or 15 (for double precision) digits by default, adjusted by the value of extra_float_digits. Now, whenever extra_float_digits is more than zero (as it now is by default), only the minimum number of digits required to preserve the exact binary value are output. The behavior is the same as before when extra_float_digits is set to zero or less.\n          Also, formatting of floating-point exponents is now uniform across platforms: two digits are used unless three are necessary. In previous releases, Windows builds always printed three digits.",
        "Treat object-name columns in the information_schema views as being of type name, not varchar (Tom Lane)\n          Per the SQL standard, object-name columns in the information_schema views are declared as being of domain type sql_identifier. In PostgreSQL, the underlying catalog columns are really of type name. This change makes sql_identifier be a domain over name, rather than varchar as before. This eliminates a semantic mismatch in comparison and sorting behavior, which can greatly improve the performance of queries on information_schema views that restrict an object-name column. Note however that inequality restrictions, for example\n          SELECT ... FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name &lt; 'foo';\n\n          will now use “C”-locale comparison semantics by default, rather than the database's default collation as before. Sorting on these columns will also follow “C” ordering rules. The previous behavior (and inefficiency) can be enforced by adding a `COLLATE \"default\"` clause.",

This caused overhead during index inserts, wasted space due to excessive page splits, and it reduced VACUUM's ability to recycle entire pages. Duplicate index entries are now sorted in heap-storage order.\n              Indexes pg_upgrade'd from previous releases will not have these benefits.",

Operations on tables that have columns created using `WITH OIDS` will need adjustment.\n          The system catalogs that previously had hidden oid columns now have ordinary oid columns.

To preserve the previous semantics of queries, columns of type name are now explicitly marked as having “C” collation. A side effect of this is that regular-expression operators on name columns will now use the “C” collation by default, not the database collation, to determine the behavior of locale-dependent regular expression patterns (such as `\\w`). If you want non-C behavior for a regular expression on a name column, attach an explicit `COLLATE` clause. (For user-defined name columns, another possibility is to specify a different collation at table creation time; but that just moves the non-backwards-compatibility to the comparison operators.)",

At the end of a development cycle, the OIDs used by committed patches will be renumbered down to lower numbers, currently somewhere in the 4`xxx` range, using the new renumber_oids.pl script. This approach should greatly reduce the odds of OID collisions between different in-process patches.\n            While there is no specific policy reserving any OIDs for external use, it is recommended that forks and other projects needing private manually-assigned OIDs use numbers in the high 7`xxx` range.

To prevent inconsistency without breaking use-cases that work today, force an implicit commit after such commands.",

This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued COMMIT but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()()` as a no-op. All known callers of `SPI_commit()()` immediately call `SPI_start_transaction()()`, so they will not notice any change. Similar remarks apply to `SPI_rollback()()`.\n          Also fix PL/Python, which omitted any handling of such errors at all, resulting in jumping out of the Python interpreter.

Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n          These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n          It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Allow the planner to apply potentially-leaky tests to child-table statistics, if the user can read the corresponding column of the table that's actually named in the query (Dilip Kumar, Amit Langote)\n          This change fixes a performance problem for partitioned tables that was created by the fix for CVE-2017-7484. That security fix disallowed applying leaky operators to statistics for columns that the current user doesn't have permission to read directly. However, it's somewhat common to grant permissions only on the parent partitioned table and not bother to do so on individual partitions. In such cases, the user can read the column via the parent, so there's no point in this security restriction; it only results in poorer planner estimates than necessary."

      "features": [
        "Fix failure in ALTER TABLE when a column referenced in a `GENERATED` expression has been added or changed in type earlier in the same ALTER command (Tom Lane)",
        "Fix failure to insert default values for “missing” attributes during tuple conversion (Vik Fearing, Andrew Gierth)\n          This could result in values incorrectly reading as NULL, when they come from columns that had been added by `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with a constant default."
      ],
      "other": [
        "Add missing permissions checks for ALTER ... DEPENDS ON EXTENSION (Álvaro Herrera)\n          Marking an object as dependent on an extension did not have any privilege check whatsoever. This oversight allowed any user to mark routines, triggers, materialized views, or indexes as droppable by anyone able to drop an extension. Require that the calling user own the specified object (and hence have privilege to drop it). (CVE-2020-1720)",
        "Fix TRUNCATE ... CASCADE to ensure all relevant partitions are truncated (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)\n          If a partition of a partitioned table is truncated with the `CASCADE` option, and the partitioned table has a foreign-key reference from another table, that table must also be truncated. The need to check this was missed if the referencing table was itself partitioned, possibly allowing rows to survive that violate the foreign-key constraint.\n          Hence, if you have foreign key constraints between partitioned tables, and you have done any partition-level TRUNCATE on the referenced table, you should check to see if any foreign key violations exist. The simplest way is to add a new instance of the foreign key constraint (and, once that succeeds, drop it or the original constraint). That may be prohibitive from a locking standpoint, however, in which case you might prefer to manually query for unmatched rows.",
        "Fix failure to attach foreign key constraints to sub-partitions (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)\n          When adding a partition to a level below the first level of a multi-level partitioned table, foreign key constraints referencing the top partitioned table were not cloned to the new partition, leading to possible constraint violations later. Detaching and re-attaching the new partition is the cheapest way to fix this. However, if there are many partitions to be fixed, adding a new instance of the foreign key constraint might be preferable.",
        "Fix possible crash during concurrent update on a partitioned table or inheritance tree (Tom Lane)",
        "Ensure that row triggers on partitioned tables are correctly cloned to sub-partitions when appropriate (Álvaro Herrera)\n          User-defined triggers (but not triggers for foreign key or deferred unique constraints) might be missed when creating or attaching a partition.",
        "Fix logical replication subscriber code to execute per-column `UPDATE` triggers when appropriate (Peter Eisentraut)",
        "Avoid failure in logical decoding when a large transaction must be spilled into many separate temporary files (Amit Khandekar)",
        "Fix possible crash or data corruption when a logical replication subscriber processes a row update (Tom Lane, Tomas Vondra)\n          This bug caused visible problems only if the subscriber's table contained columns that were not being copied from the publisher and had pass-by-reference data types.",

        "Ensure parallel plans are always shut down at the correct time (Kyotaro Horiguchi)\n          This oversight is known to result in “temporary file leak” warnings from multi-batch parallel hash joins.",
        "Prevent premature shutdown of a Gather or GatherMerge plan node that is underneath a Limit node (Amit Kapila)\n          This avoids failure if such a plan node needs to be scanned more than once, as for instance if it is on the inside of a nestloop.",

        "Ignore the `CONCURRENTLY` option when performing an index creation, drop, or rebuild on a temporary table (Michael Paquier, Heikki Linnakangas, Andres Freund)\n          This avoids strange failures if the temporary table has an `ON COMMIT` action. There is no benefit in using `CONCURRENTLY` for a temporary table anyway, since other sessions cannot access the table, making the extra processing pointless.",
        "Fix possible failure when resetting expression indexes on temporary tables that are marked `ON COMMIT DELETE ROWS` (Tom Lane)",

        "Fix crash after FileClose() failure (Noah Misch)\n          This issue could only be observed with data_sync_retry enabled, since otherwise FileClose() failure would be reported as a PANIC.",
        "Fix handling of multiple `AFTER ROW` triggers on a foreign table (Etsuro Fujita)",
        "Fix unlikely crash with pass-by-reference aggregate transition states (Andres Freund, Teodor Sigaev)",
        "Improve error reporting in `to_date()()` and `to_timestamp()()` (Tom Lane, Álvaro Herrera)\n          Reports about incorrect month or day names in input strings could truncate the input in the middle of a multi-byte character, leading to an improperly encoded error message that could cause follow-on failures. Truncate at the next whitespace instead.",
        "Fix off-by-one result for `EXTRACT(ISOYEAR FROM `timestamp`)` for BC dates (Tom Lane)",
        "Ensure that the `&lt;&gt;` operator for type char reports indeterminate-collation errors as such, rather than as “cache lookup failed for collation 0” (Tom Lane)",
        "Avoid treating TID scans as sequential scans (Tatsuhito Kasahara)\n          A refactoring oversight caused TID scans (selection by CTID) to be counted as sequential scans in the statistics views, and to take whole-table predicate locks as sequential scans do. The latter behavior could cause unnecessary serialization errors in serializable transaction mode.",
        "Avoid stack overflow in `information_schema` views when a self-referential view exists in the system catalogs (Tom Lane)\n          A self-referential view can't work; it will always result in infinite recursion. We handled that situation correctly when trying to execute the view, but not when inquiring whether it is automatically updatable.",
        "Ensure that walsender processes always show NULL for transaction start time in pg_stat_activity (Álvaro Herrera)\n          Previously, the xact_start column would sometimes show the process start time.",
        "Reduce spinlock contention when there are many active walsender processes (Pierre Ducroquet)",
        "Fix placement of “Subplans Removed” field in EXPLAIN output (Daniel Gustafsson, Tom Lane)\n          In non-text output formats, this field was emitted inside the “Plans” sub-group, resulting in syntactically invalid output. Attach it to the parent Append or MergeAppend plan node as intended. This causes the field to change position in text output format too: if there are any InitPlans attached to the same plan node, “Subplans Removed” will now appear before those.",
        "Fix EXPLAIN's `SETTINGS` option to print as empty in non-text output formats (Tom Lane)\n          In the non-text output formats, fields are supposed to appear when requested, even if they have empty or zero values.",
        "Fix planner errors induced by overly-aggressive collapsing of joins to single-row subqueries (Tom Lane)\n          This mistake led to errors such as “failed to construct the join relation”.",
        "Fix “no = operator for opfamily `NNNN`” planner error when trying to match a `LIKE` or regex pattern-match operator to a binary-compatible index opclass (Tom Lane)",
        "Fix edge-case crashes and misestimations in selectivity calculations for the `&lt;@` and `@&gt;` range operators (Michael Paquier, Andrey Borodin, Tom Lane)",
        "Fix incorrect estimation for `OR` clauses when using most-common-value extended statistics (Tomas Vondra)",
        "Ignore system columns when applying most-common-value extended statistics (Tomas Vondra)\n          This prevents “negative bitmapset member not allowed” planner errors for affected queries.",
        "Fix BRIN index logic to support hypothetical BRIN indexes (Julien Rouhaud, Heikki Linnakangas)\n          Previously, if an “index adviser” extension tried to get the planner to produce a plan involving a hypothetical BRIN index, that would fail, because the BRIN cost estimation code would always try to physically access the index's metapage. Now it checks to see if the index is only hypothetical, and uses default assumptions about the index parameters if so.",
        "Improve error reporting for attempts to use automatic updating of views with conditional `INSTEAD` rules (Dean Rasheed)\n          This has never been supported, but previously the error was thrown only at execution time, so that it could be masked by planner errors.",
        "Prevent a composite type from being included in itself indirectly via a range type (Tom Lane, Julien Rouhaud)",
        "Disallow partition key expressions that return pseudo-types, such as record (Tom Lane)",
        "Fix error reporting for index expressions of prohibited types (Amit Langote)",
        "Fix dumping of views that contain only a `VALUES` list to handle cases where a view output column has been renamed (Tom Lane)",
        "Ensure that data types and collations used in `XMLTABLE` constructs are accounted for when computing dependencies of a view or rule (Tom Lane)\n          Previously it was possible to break a view using `XMLTABLE` by dropping a type, if the type was not otherwise referenced in the view. This fix does not correct the dependencies already recorded for existing views, only for newly-created ones.",
        "Prevent unwanted downcasing and truncation of RADIUS authentication parameters (Marcos David)\n          The pg_hba.conf parser mistakenly treated these fields as SQL identifiers, which in general they aren't.",
        "Transmit incoming NOTIFY messages to the client before sending `ReadyForQuery`, rather than after (Tom Lane)\n          This change ensures that, with libpq and other client libraries that act similarly to it, any notifications received during a transaction will be available by the time the client thinks the transaction is complete. This probably makes no difference in practical applications (which would need to cope with asynchronous notifications in any case); but it makes it easier to build test cases with reproducible behavior.",
        "Fix bugs in handling of non-blocking I/O when using GSSAPI encryption (Tom Lane)\n          These errors could result in dropping data (usually leading to subsequent wire-protocol-violation errors) or in a “livelock” situation where a sending process goes to sleep although not all its data has been sent. Moreover, libpq failed to keep separate encryption state for each connection, creating the possibility for failures in applications using multiple encrypted database connections.",
        "Allow libpq to parse all GSS-related connection parameters even when the GSSAPI code hasn't been compiled in (Tom Lane)\n          This makes the behavior similar to our SSL support, where it was long ago deemed to be a good idea to always accept all the related parameters, even if some are ignored or restricted due to lack of the feature in a particular build.",
        "Fix incorrect handling of `%b` and `%B` format codes in ecpg's `PGTYPEStimestamp_fmt_asc()()` function (Tomas Vondra)\n          Due to an off-by-one error, these codes would print the wrong month name, or possibly crash.",
        "Avoid crash after an out-of-memory failure in ecpglib (Tom Lane)",
        "Fix parallel pg_dump/pg_restore to more gracefully handle failure to create worker processes (Tom Lane)",
        "Prevent possible crash or lockup when attempting to terminate a parallel pg_dump/pg_restore run via a signal (Tom Lane)",
        "In pg_upgrade, look inside arrays and ranges while searching for non-upgradable data types in tables (Tom Lane)",
        "Apply more thorough syntax checking to createuser's --connection-limit option (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Cope with changes of the specific type referenced by a PL/pgSQL composite-type variable in more cases (Ashutosh Sharma, Tom Lane)\n          Dropping and re-creating the composite type referenced by a PL/pgSQL variable could lead to “could not open relation with OID `NNNN`” errors.",
        "Avoid crash in postgres_fdw when trying to send a command like `UPDATE remote_tab SET (x,y) = (SELECT ...)` to the remote server (Tom Lane)",
        "In contrib/dict_int, reject maxlen settings less than one (Tomas Vondra)\n          This prevents a possible crash with silly settings for that parameter.",
        "Disallow NULL category values in contrib/tablefunc's `crosstab()()` function (Joe Conway)\n          This case never worked usefully, and it would crash on some platforms.",
        "Fix configure's probe for OpenSSL's `SSL_clear_options()()` function so that it works with OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0 (Michael Paquier, Daniel Gustafsson)\n          This problem could lead to failure to set the SSL compression option as desired, when PostgreSQL is built against an old version of OpenSSL.",
        "Mark some timeout and statistics-tracking GUC variables as `PGDLLIMPORT`, to allow extensions to access them on Windows (Pascal Legrand)\n          This applies to `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`, `lock_timeout`, `statement_timeout`, `track_activities`, `track_counts`, and `track_functions`.",
        "Avoid memory leak in sanity checks for “slab” memory contexts (Tomas Vondra)\n          This isn't an issue for production builds, since they wouldn't ordinarily have memory context checking enabled; but the leak could be quite severe in a debug build.",
        "Fix multiple statistics entries reported by the LWLock statistics mechanism (Fujii Masao)\n          The LWLock statistics code (which is not built by default; it requires compiling with -DLWLOCK_STATS) could report multiple entries for the same LWLock and backend process, as a result of faulty hashtable key creation.",
        "Fix race condition that led to delayed delivery of interprocess signals on Windows (Amit Kapila)\n          This caused visible timing oddities in NOTIFY, and perhaps other misbehavior.",
        "Fix handling of a corner-case error result from Windows' `ReadFile()()` function (Thomas Munro, Juan José Santamaría Flecha)\n          So far as is known, this oversight just resulted in noisy log messages, not any actual query misbehavior.",
        "On Windows, retry a few times after an `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED` file access failure (Alexander Lakhin, Tom Lane)\n          This helps cope with cases where a file open attempt fails because the targeted file is flagged for deletion but not yet actually gone. pg_ctl, for example, frequently failed with such an error when probing to see if the postmaster had shut down yet.",
        "On Windows, work around sharing violations for the postmaster's log file when pg_ctl is used to start the postmaster very shortly after it's been stopped, for example by `pg_ctl restart` (Alexander Lakhin)"

        "Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump (Masahiko Sawada)\n          An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg_dump session with the privileges of the role running pg_dump (which is often a superuser). The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will execute malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server parameter restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind that can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and teach pg_dump to set it when available. Note that the attack is prevented only if both pg_dump and the server it is dumping from are new enough to have this fix.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem. (CVE-2024-7348)",
        "Fix failure after attaching a table as a partition, if the table had previously had inheritance children (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Fix ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION for cases involving inconsistent index-based constraints (Álvaro Herrera, Tender Wang)\n          When a partitioned table has an index that is not associated with a constraint, but a partition has an equivalent index that is, then detaching the partition would misbehave, leaving the ex-partition's constraint with an incorrect coninhcount value. This would cause trouble during any further manipulations of that constraint.",
        "Fix handling of polymorphic output arguments for procedures (Tom Lane)\n          The SQL CALL statement did not resolve the correct data types for such arguments, leading to errors such as “cannot display a value of type anyelement”, or even outright crashes. (But CALL in PL/pgSQL worked correctly.)",
        "Fix behavior of stable functions called from a CALL statement's argument list (Tom Lane)\n          If the CALL is within an atomic context (e.g. there's an outer transaction block), such functions were passed the wrong snapshot, causing them to see stale values of rows modified since the start of the outer transaction.",
        "Detect integer overflow in money calculations (Joseph Koshakow)\n          None of the arithmetic functions for the money type checked for overflow before, so they would silently give wrong answers for overflowing cases.",
        "Fix over-aggressive clamping of the scale argument in `round(numeric)()` and `trunc(numeric)()` (Dean Rasheed)\n          These functions clamped their scale argument to +/-2000, but there are valid use-cases for it to be larger; the functions returned incorrect results in such cases. Instead clamp to the actual allowed range of type numeric.",

        "Fix parsing of ignored operators in `websearch_to_tsquery()()` (Tom Lane)\n          Per the manual, punctuation in the input of `websearch_to_tsquery()()` is ignored except for the special cases of dashes and quotes. However, parentheses and a few other characters appearing immediately before an `or` could cause `or` to be treated as a data word, rather than as an `OR` operator as expected.",

This is only possible in the pg_database catalog, so the effects are narrow, but misbehavior is possible.",
        "Correctly check updatability of view columns targeted by `INSERT` ... `DEFAULT` (Tom Lane)\n          If such a column is non-updatable, we should give an error reporting that.

        "Don't throw an error if a queued `AFTER` trigger no longer exists (Tom Lane)\n          It's possible for a transaction to execute an operation that queues a deferred `AFTER` trigger for later execution, and then to drop the trigger before that happens. Formerly this led to weird errors such as “could not find trigger `NNNN`”. It seems better to silently do nothing if the trigger no longer exists at the time when it would have been executed.",
        "Fix failure to remove pg_init_privs entries for column-level privileges when their table is dropped (Tom Lane)\n          If an extension grants some column-level privileges on a table it creates, relevant catalog entries would remain behind after the extension is dropped. This was harmless until/unless the table's OID was re-used for another relation, when it could interfere with what pg_dump dumps for that relation.",

But subtransactions of a prepared transaction (created by savepoints or PL/pgSQL exception blocks) were not accounted for and would be treated as aborted.

In a database with many triggers this would make a significant speed difference for queries of that form. Since things worked that way before v11, this is a potential performance regression.

Some of the risks here are equivalent to those described in CVE-2018-1058, and are mitigated in this patch by ensuring that the replication sender and receiver execute with empty search_path settings. (As with CVE-2018-1058, that change might cause problems for under-qualified names used in replicated tables' DDL.) Other risks are inherent in replicating objects that belong to untrusted roles; the most we can do is document that there is a hazard to consider. (CVE-2020-14349)",
        "Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)\n          Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried out against an extension installation script, if the attacker can create objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema of some prerequisite extension. Since extensions often require superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining superuser privilege. To mitigate this risk, be more careful about the search_path used to run an installation script; disable check_function_bodies within the script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib modules to ensure they are secure. Also provide documentation to help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts secure. This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on other extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly. (CVE-2020-14350)",

However, the range check was miscoded so that it would accept “23:59:60.`nnn`” with nonzero fractional-second `nnn`. In timestamp values this would result in wrapping into the first second of the next day.

There's no easy way to correct that mistake in existing installations (though v13 and later will have the correct markings). The main place that depends on that marking being correct is JIT-enabled tuple deconstruction, so teach it to explicitly ignore the marking for these two columns. Also adjust some C code that accessed srsublsn without checking to see if it's null; a crash from that is improbable but perhaps not impossible.",

But using the query's collation is arguably more correct. More importantly, now that we have nondeterministic collations, there are cases where an operator will fail outright if given a nondeterministic collation. We don't want planning to fail in cases where the query itself would work, so this means that we must use the query's collation when invoking operators for estimation purposes.",

This could allow a serializable transaction to commit when it should have failed with a serialization error.",

This fix primarily improves the ability to do a parallel restore from such a file.",
        "Fix parallel restore of tables having both table-level privileges and per-column privileges (Tom Lane)\n          The table-level privilege grants have to be applied first, but a parallel restore did not reliably order them that way; this could lead to “tuple concurrently updated” errors, or to disappearance of some per-column privilege grants. The fix for this is to include dependency links between such entries in the archive file, meaning that a new dump has to be taken with a corrected pg_dump to ensure that the problem will not recur.",

However, it appears that calling `WSACleanup()()` can interfere with other program operations; notably, we have observed rare failures to emit expected output to stdout.

In cases where these programs need to initiate additional connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were used for the additional connections. This could lead to connection failures if the connection string included any other essential information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters.

Worse, the reconnection might succeed but not be encrypted as intended, or be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the intended connection parameters would have prevented.

        "Fix mishandling of “junk” columns in `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... UPDATE` target lists (Tom Lane)\n          If the `UPDATE` list contains any multi-column sub-selects (which give rise to junk columns in addition to the results proper), the `UPDATE` path would end up storing tuples that include the values of the extra junk columns. That's fairly harmless in the short run, but if new columns are added to the table then the values would become accessible, possibly leading to malfunctions if they don't match the datatypes of the added columns.\n          In addition, in versions supporting cross-partition updates, a cross-partition update triggered by such a case had the reverse problem: the junk columns were removed from the target list, typically causing an immediate crash due to malfunction of the multi-column sub-select mechanism. (CVE-2021-32028)",
        "Fix pg_dump's dumping of generated columns in partitioned tables (Peter Eisentraut)\n          A fix introduced in the previous minor release should not be applied to partitioned tables, only traditionally-inherited tables."

        "Prevent integer overflows in array subscripting calculations (Tom Lane)\n          The array code previously did not complain about cases where an array's lower bound plus length overflows an integer. This resulted in later entries in the array becoming inaccessible (since their subscripts could not be written as integers), but more importantly it confused subsequent assignment operations. This could lead to memory overwrites, with ensuing crashes or unwanted data modifications. (CVE-2021-32027)",
        "Fix possibly-incorrect computation of UPDATE ... RETURNING outputs for joined cross-partition updates (Amit Langote, Etsuro Fujita)\n          If an UPDATE for a partitioned table caused a row to be moved to another partition with a physically different row type (for example, one with a different set of dropped columns), computation of `RETURNING` results for that row could produce errors or wrong answers. No error is observed unless the UPDATE involves other tables being joined to the target table. (CVE-2021-32029)",
        "Fix adjustment of constraint deferrability properties in partitioned tables (Álvaro Herrera)\n          When applied to a foreign-key constraint of a partitioned table, ALTER TABLE ... ALTER CONSTRAINT failed to adjust the `DEFERRABLE` and/or `INITIALLY DEFERRED` markings of the constraints and triggers of leaf partitions. This led to unexpected behavior of such constraints. After updating to this version, any misbehaving partitioned tables can be fixed by executing a new ALTER command to set the desired properties.\n          This change also disallows applying such an ALTER directly to the constraints of leaf partitions. The only supported case is for the whole partitioning hierarchy to have identical constraint properties, so such ALTERs must be applied at the partition root.",

SET` to set the role, session_authorization, and temp_buffers parameters (Tom Lane)\n          Previously, over-eager validity checks might reject these commands, even if the values would have worked when used later.

While that normally has no real impact (since `COLLATE` has no effect at runtime), it was possible to construct views that would be rejected during dump/reload.",

        "Avoid incorrect timeline change while recovering uncommitted two-phase transactions from WAL (Soumyadeep Chakraborty, Jimmy Yih, Kevin Yeap)\n          This error could lead to subsequent WAL records being written under the wrong timeline ID, leading to consistency problems, or even complete failure to be able to restart the server, later on.",
        "Ensure that locks are released while shutting down a standby server's startup process (Fujii Masao)\n          When a standby server is shut down while still in recovery, some locks might be left held.

For a NO SCROLL cursor, we can fix this by only storing the not-yet-read portion of the query output, which is sufficient since a NO SCROLL cursor can't be backed up. Cursors with the SCROLL option remain at hazard, but that was already documented to be an unsafe option to use with a non-stable query.

This could probably be abused to inject faked responses to the client's first few queries, although other details of libpq's behavior make that harder than it sounds. A different line of attack is to exfiltrate the client's password, or other sensitive data that might be sent early in the session.

This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n          When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

The previous fix for this type of problem failed to account for PREPARE TRANSACTION commands that were still in progress when CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY checked for them.

This failed to happen before, meaning that hash indexes and hash-based query plans might produce incorrect results for non-canonical NaN values.

        "Allow hash aggregation to use disk storage for large aggregation result sets (Jeff Davis)\n              Previously, hash aggregation was avoided if it was expected to use more than work_mem memory. Now, a hash aggregation plan can be chosen despite that. The hash table will be spilled to disk if it exceeds work_mem times hash_mem_multiplier.\n              This behavior is normally preferable to the old behavior, in which once hash aggregation had been chosen, the hash table would be kept in memory no matter how large it got — which could be very large if the planner had misestimated. If necessary, behavior similar to that can be obtained by increasing hash_mem_multiplier.",

However, a vacuum scan has other useful side-effects such as setting page-all-visible bits, which improves the efficiency of index-only scans. Also, allowing an insert-only table to receive periodic vacuuming helps to spread out the work of “freezing” old tuples, so that there is not suddenly a large amount of freezing work to do when the entire table reaches the anti-wraparound threshold all at once.\n              If necessary, this behavior can be adjusted with the new parameters autovacuum_vacuum_insert_threshold and autovacuum_vacuum_insert_scale_factor, or the equivalent table storage options.",

In cases where these programs need to initiate additional connections, such as parallel processing or processing of multiple databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the basic connection parameters (database name, host, port, and username) were used for the additional connections. This could lead to connection failures if the connection string included any other essential information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters.

After updating to this version, any misbehaving partitioned tables can be fixed by executing a new ALTER command to set the desired properties.\n          This change also disallows applying such an ALTER directly to the constraints of leaf partitions. The only supported case is for the whole partitioning hierarchy to have identical constraint properties, so such ALTERs must be applied at the partition root.",

For a NO SCROLL cursor, we can fix this by only storing the not-yet-read portion of the query output, which is sufficient since a NO SCROLL cursor can't be backed up. Cursors with the SCROLL option remain at hazard, but that was already documented to be an unsafe option to use with a non-stable query.

This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n          When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

Presumably, once 3.12 is out, `configure --with-python` would fail altogether.

If any operations had been done on such an index without first upgrading the `ltree` extension to version 1.2, they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes rather than the intended 8. This means it is very likely that such indexes are now corrupt. For safety we recommend re-indexing all GiST indexes on ltree columns after installing this update.

We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n          In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type record to begin with and there's no issue.",

Namely, in addition to the current rules, allow the case where the key file is owned by root and has permissions `rw-r-----` or less. This is helpful for system-wide management of key files.",
        "Fix behavior of libpq's `PQisBusy()()` function after a connection failure (Tom Lane)\n          If we'd detected a write failure, `PQisBusy()()` would always return true, which is the wrong thing: we want input processing to carry on normally until we've read whatever is available from the server. The practical effect of this error is that applications using libpq's async-query API would typically detect connection loss only when `PQconsumeInput()()` returns a hard failure. With this fix, a connection loss will normally be reported via an error PGresult object, which is a much cleaner behavior for most applications.",

If the postmaster died uncleanly without having removed its PID file or updated the control file, pg_ctl would wait until timeout.

This prevents a form of trojan-horse attack in which a hostile database user could become the owner of an extension object and then modify it to compromise future uses of the object by other users.

This led to misbehaviors when a PL procedure issued COMMIT but a failure occurred (such as a deferred constraint check). To improve matters, redefine `SPI_commit()()` as starting a new transaction, so that it becomes equivalent to `SPI_commit_and_chain()()` except that you get default transaction characteristics instead of preserving the prior transaction's characteristics. To make this somewhat transparent API-wise, redefine `SPI_start_transaction()()` as a no-op.

        "Avoid rare PANIC during updates occurring concurrently with VACUUM (Tom Lane, Jeff Davis)\n          If a concurrent VACUUM sets the all-visible flag bit in a page that UPDATE or DELETE is in process of modifying, the updating command needs to clear that bit again; but some code paths failed to do so, ending in a PANIC exit and database restart.\n          This is known to be possible in versions 14 and 15. It may be only latent in previous branches.",
        "Fix VACUUM to press on if an attempted page deletion in a btree index fails to find the page's parent downlink (Peter Geoghegan)\n          Rather than throwing an error, just log the issue and continue without deleting the empty page. Previously, a buggy operator class or corrupted index could indefinitely prevent completion of vacuuming of the index, eventually leading to transaction wraparound problems.",
        "Fix handling of `DEFAULT` tokens that appear in a multi-row `VALUES` clause of an INSERT on an updatable view (Tom Lane)\n          This oversight could lead to “cache lookup failed for type” errors, or in older branches even to crashes.",
        "Disallow rules named `_RETURN` that are not `ON SELECT` (Tom Lane)\n          This avoids confusion between a view's `ON SELECT` rule and any other rules it may have.",
        "Fix resource management bug in saving tuples for `AFTER` triggers (Tom Lane)\n          Given the right circumstances, this manifested as a “tupdesc reference `NNNN` is not owned by resource owner” error followed by a PANIC exit.",
        "Repair rare failure of MULTIEXPR_SUBLINK subplans in inherited updates (Tom Lane)\n          Use of the syntax `UPDATE tab SET (c1, ...) = (SELECT ...)` with an inherited or partitioned target table could result in failure if the child tables are sufficiently dissimilar. This typically manifested as failure of consistency checks in the executor; but a crash or incorrect data updates are also possible.",
        "Fix generation of constraint names for per-partition foreign key constraints (Jehan-Guillaume de Rorthais)\n          If the initially-given name is already in use for some constraint of the partition, a new one is selected; but it wasn't being spelled as intended.",
        "Fix incorrect matching of index expressions and predicates when creating a partitioned index (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)\n          While creating a partitioned index, we try to identify any existing indexes on the partitions that match the partitioned index, so that we can absorb those as child indexes instead of building new ones. Matching of expressions was not done right, so that a usable child index might be ignored, leading to creation of a duplicative index.",
        "Prevent WAL corruption after a standby promotion (Dilip Kumar, Robert Haas)\n          When a PostgreSQL instance performing archive recovery (but not using standby mode) is promoted, and the last WAL segment that it attempted to read ended in a partial record, the instance would write an invalid WAL segment on the new timeline.",
        "Fix mis-ordering of WAL operations in fast insert path for GIN indexes (Matthias van de Meent, Zhang Mingli)\n          This mistake is not known to have any negative consequences within core PostgreSQL, but it did cause issues for some extensions.",
        "Fix bugs in logical decoding when replay starts from a point between the beginning of a transaction and the beginning of its subtransaction (Masahiko Sawada, Kuroda Hayato)\n          These errors could lead to assertion failures in debug builds, and otherwise to memory leaks.",
        "Prevent examining system catalogs with the wrong snapshot during logical decoding (Masahiko Sawada)\n          If decoding begins partway through a transaction that modifies system catalogs, the decoder may not recognize that, causing it to fail to treat that transaction as in-progress for catalog lookups.",
        "Accept interrupts in more places during logical decoding (Amit Kapila, Masahiko Sawada)\n          This ameliorates problems with slow shutdown of replication workers.",
        "Prevent attempts to replicate into a foreign-table partition in replication workers (Shi Yu, Tom Lane)\n          Although partitioned tables can have foreign tables as partitions, replicating into such a partition isn't currently supported. The logical replication worker process would crash if it was attempted. Now, an error is thrown.",
        "Remove pointless check on replica identity setting of partitioned tables (Hou Zhijie)\n          What matters is the replica identity setting of the leaf partitions, so there's no need to throw error if it's not set on the parent.",
        "Avoid crash after function syntax error in replication workers (Maxim Orlov, Anton Melnikov, Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane)\n          If a syntax error occurred in a SQL-language or PL/pgSQL-language CREATE FUNCTION or DO command executed in a logical replication worker, the worker process would crash with a null pointer dereference or assertion failure.",
        "Fix handling of read-write expanded datums that are passed to SQL functions (Tom Lane)\n          If a non-inlined SQL function uses a parameter in more than one place, and one of those functions expects to be able to modify read-write datums in place, then later uses of the parameter would observe the wrong value. (Within core PostgreSQL, the expanded-datum mechanism is only used for array and composite-type values; but extensions might use it for other structured types.)",
        "Fix type circle's equality comparator to handle NaNs properly (Ranier Vilela)\n          If the left-hand circle had a floating-point NaN for its radius, it would be considered equal to a circle with the same center and any radius.",
        "Fix use-after-free hazard in string comparisons (Tom Lane)\n          Improper memory management in the string comparison functions could result in scribbling on no-longer-allocated buffers, potentially breaking things for whatever is using that memory now. This would only happen with fairly long strings (more than 1kB), and only if an ICU collation is in use.",
        "Add plan-time check for attempted access to a table that has no table access method (Tom Lane)\n          This prevents a crash in some catalog-corruption scenarios, for example use of a view whose `ON SELECT` rule is missing.",
        "Prevent postmaster crash when shared-memory state is corrupted (Tom Lane)\n          The postmaster process is supposed to survive and initiate a database restart if shared memory becomes corrupted, but one bit of code was being insufficiently cautious about that.",
        "Add some more defenses against recursion till stack overrun (Richard Guo, Tom Lane)",
        "Avoid misbehavior when choosing hash table size with very small work_mem and large tuples (Zhang Mingli)",
        "Avoid long-term memory leakage in the autovacuum launcher process (Reid Thompson)\n          The lack of field reports suggests that this problem is only latent in pre-v15 branches; but it's not very clear why, so back-patch the fix anyway.",
        "Improve PL/pgSQL's ability to handle parameters declared as RECORD (Tom Lane)\n          Build a separate function cache entry for each concrete type passed to the RECORD parameter during a session, much as we do for polymorphic parameters. This allows some usages to work that previously failed with errors such as “type of parameter does not match that when preparing the plan”.",
        "Add missing guards for `NULL` connection pointer in libpq (Daniele Varrazzo, Tom Lane)\n          There's a convention that libpq functions should check for a NULL PGconn argument, and fail gracefully instead of crashing. `PQflush()()` and `PQisnonblocking()()` didn't get that memo, so fix them.",
        "In ecpg, fix omission of variable storage classes when multiple varchar or bytea variables are declared in the same declaration (Andrey Sokolov)\n          For example, ecpg translated `static varchar str1[10], str2[20], str3[30];` in such a way that only str1 was marked `static`.",
        "Allow cross-platform tablespace relocation in pg_basebackup (Robert Haas)\n          Allow the remote path in --tablespace-mapping to be either a Unix-style or Windows-style absolute path, since the source server could be on a different OS than the local system.",
        "In pg_stat_statements, fix access to already-freed memory (zhaoqigui)\n          This occurred if pg_stat_statements tracked a ROLLBACK command issued via extended query protocol. In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion failure. In production builds there would often be no visible ill effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely result would be to store garbage for the query string.",
        "In postgres_fdw, ensure that target lists constructed for EvalPlanQual plans will have all required columns (Richard Guo, Etsuro Fujita)\n          This avoids “variable not found in subplan target list” errors in rare cases.",
        "Reject unwanted output from the platform's `uuid_create()()` function (Nazir Bilal Yavuz)\n          The uuid-ossp module expects libc's `uuid_create()()` to produce a version-1 UUID, but recent NetBSD releases produce a version-4 (random) UUID instead. Check for that, and complain if so. Drop the documentation's claim that the NetBSD implementation is usable for uuid-ossp. (If a version-4 UUID is okay for your purposes, you don't need uuid-ossp at all; just use `gen_random_uuid()()`.)",
        "Include new Perl test modules in standard installations (Álvaro Herrera)\n          Add PostgreSQL/Test/Cluster.pm and PostgreSQL/Test/Utils.pm to the standard installation file set in pre-version-15 branches. This is for the benefit of extensions that want to use newly-written test code in older branches.",

        "Allow use of `__sync_lock_test_and_set()()` for spinlocks on any machine (Tom Lane)\n          This eases porting to new machine architectures, at least if you're using a compiler that supports this GCC builtin function.",

        "Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2022f for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Iran, Jordan, Mexico, Palestine, and Syria, plus historical corrections for Chile, Crimea, Iran, and Mexico.\n          Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n          These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n          It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Allow vacuum to skip index vacuuming when the number of removable index entries is insignificant (Masahiko Sawada, Peter Geoghegan)\n              The vacuum parameter `INDEX_CLEANUP` has a new default of `auto` that enables this optimization.",
        "Speed up vacuuming of databases with many relations (Tatsuhito Kasahara)",
        "Improve the performance of updates and deletes on partitioned tables with many partitions (Amit Langote, Tom Lane)\n              This change greatly reduces the planner's overhead for such cases, and also allows updates/deletes on partitioned tables to use execution-time partition pruning.",
        "Allow some GiST indexes to be built by presorting the data (Andrey Borodin)\n              Presorting happens automatically and allows for faster index creation and smaller indexes.",
        "Improve the speed of computing MVCC visibility snapshots on systems with many CPUs and high session counts (Andres Freund)\n              This also improves performance when there are many idle sessions.",
        "Improve the I/O performance of parallel sequential scans (Thomas Munro, David Rowley)\n              This was done by allocating blocks in groups to parallel workers.",

        "Speed truncation of small tables during recovery on clusters with a large number of shared buffers (Kirk Jamison)",
        "Allow file system sync at the start of crash recovery on Linux (Thomas Munro)\n            By default, PostgreSQL opens and fsyncs each data file in the database cluster at the start of crash recovery. A new setting, recovery_init_sync_method`=syncfs`, instead syncs each filesystem used by the cluster. This allows for faster recovery on systems with many database files.",
        "Allow logical replication subscriptions to use binary transfer mode (Dave Cramer)\n              This is faster than text mode, but slightly less robust.",

        "Allow SQL-language functions and procedures to use SQL-standard function bodies (Peter Eisentraut)\n            Previously only string-literal function bodies were supported. When writing a function or procedure in SQL-standard syntax, the body is parsed immediately and stored as a parse tree. This allows better tracking of function dependencies, and can have security benefits.",
        "Mark built-in type coercion functions as leakproof where possible (Tom Lane)\n            This allows more use of functions that require type conversion in security-sensitive situations."

        "Allow REINDEX to change the tablespace of the new index (Alexey Kondratov, Michael Paquier, Justin Pryzby)\n            This is done by specifying a `TABLESPACE` clause. A --tablespace option was also added to reindexdb to control this.",

        "Allow publications to be more easily added to and removed from a subscription (Japin Li)\n            The new syntax is ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ADD/DROP PUBLICATION. This avoids having to specify all publications to add/remove entries.",
        "Provide feature-test macros in libpq-fe.h for recently-added libpq features (Tom Lane, Álvaro Herrera)\n            Historically, applications have usually used compile-time checks of `PG_VERSION_NUM` to test whether a feature is available. But that's normally the server version, which might not be a good guide to libpq's version. libpq-fe.h now offers `#define` symbols denoting application-visible features added in v14; the intent is to keep adding symbols for such features in future versions."

        "Range types have been extended by adding multiranges, allowing representation of noncontiguous data ranges.",
        "B-tree index updates are managed more efficiently, reducing index bloat.",

Therefore, user-defined objects like aggregates and operators that reference those array function signatures must be dropped before upgrading, and recreated once the upgrade completes.",
        "Remove deprecated containment operators `@` and `~` for built-in geometric data types and contrib modules cube, hstore, intarray, and seg (Justin Pryzby)\n          The more consistently named `&lt;@` and `@&gt;` have been recommended for many years.",
        "Fix `to_tsquery()()` and `websearch_to_tsquery()()` to properly parse query text containing discarded tokens (Alexander Korotkov)\n          Certain discarded tokens, like underscore, caused the output of these functions to produce incorrect tsquery output, e.g., both `websearch_to_tsquery('\"pg_class pg\"')` and `to_tsquery('pg_class &lt;-&gt; pg')` used to output `( 'pg' &amp; 'class' ) &lt;-&gt; 'pg'`, but now both output `'pg' &lt;-&gt; 'class' &lt;-&gt; 'pg'`.",
        "Fix `websearch_to_tsquery()()` to properly parse multiple adjacent discarded tokens in quotes (Alexander Korotkov)\n          Previously, quoted text that contained multiple adjacent discarded tokens was treated as multiple tokens, causing incorrect tsquery output, e.g., `websearch_to_tsquery('\"aaa: bbb\"')` used to output `'aaa' &lt;2&gt; 'bbb'`, but now outputs `'aaa' &lt;-&gt; 'bbb'`.",

The old behavior can still be obtained by using the old underlying function `date_part()()`.\n          Also, `EXTRACT(date)()` now throws an error for units that are not part of the date data type.",
        "Change `var_samp()()` and `stddev_samp()()` with numeric parameters to return NULL when the input is a single NaN value (Tom Lane)\n          Previously `NaN` was returned.",

        "Remove support for postfix (right-unary) operators (Mark Dilger)\n          pg_dump and pg_upgrade will warn if postfix operators are being dumped.",
        "Allow `\\D` and `\\W` shorthands to match newlines in regular expression newline-sensitive mode (Tom Lane)\n          Previously they did not match newlines in this mode, but that disagrees with the behavior of other common regular expression engines. `[^[:digit:]]` or `[^[:word:]]` can be used to get the old behavior.",
        "Disregard constraints when matching regular expression back-references (Tom Lane)\n          For example, in `(^\\d+).*\\1`, the `^` constraint should be applied at the start of the string, but not when matching `\\1`.",
        "Disallow `\\w` as a range start or end in regular expression character classes (Tom Lane)\n          This previously was allowed but produced unexpected results.",

        "Change the default of the password_encryption server parameter to `scram-sha-256` (Peter Eisentraut)\n          Previously it was `md5`. All new passwords will be stored as SHA256 unless this server setting is changed or the password is specified in MD5 format. Also, the legacy (and undocumented) Boolean-like values which were previously synonyms for `md5` are no longer accepted.",

        "Overhaul the specification of `clientcert` in pg_hba.conf (Kyotaro Horiguchi)\n          Values `1`/`0`/`no-verify` are no longer supported; only the strings `verify-ca` and `verify-full` can be used. Also, disallow `verify-ca` if cert authentication is enabled since cert requires `verify-full` checking.",

        "Remove the composite types that were formerly created for sequences and toast tables (Tom Lane)",
        "Process doubled quote marks in ecpg SQL command strings correctly (Tom Lane)\n          Previously `'abc''def'` was passed to the server as `'abc'def'`, and `\"abc\"\"def\"` was passed as `\"abc\"def\"`, causing syntax errors.",

This is problematic since standby servers may already have copies of that WAL segment. They will then see an inconsistent next segment, and will not be able to recover without manual intervention. To fix, do not back up over a WAL segment boundary when restarting after a crash. Instead write a new type of WAL record at the start of the next WAL segment, informing readers that the incomplete WAL record will never be finished and must be disregarded.\n          When applying this update, it's best to update standby servers before the primary, so that they will be ready to handle this new WAL record type if the primary happens to crash.",

This would cause trouble during any further manipulations of that constraint.",
        "Fix partition pruning setup during `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` (Álvaro Herrera)\n          The executor assumed that no partition could be detached between planning and execution of a query on a partitioned table.

But subtransactions of a prepared transaction (created by savepoints or PL/pgSQL exception blocks) were not accounted for and would be treated as aborted. That led to inconsistency if the prepared transaction was later committed.",

        "Enforce standard locking protocol for TOAST table updates, to prevent problems with REINDEX CONCURRENTLY (Michael Paquier)\n          If applied to a TOAST table or TOAST table's index, REINDEX CONCURRENTLY tended to produce a corrupted index. This happened because sessions updating TOAST entries released their `ROW EXCLUSIVE` locks immediately, rather than holding them until transaction commit as all other updates do. The fix is to make TOAST updates hold the table lock according to the normal rule. Any existing corrupted indexes can be repaired by reindexing again.",

When the tuple's item slot is later re-used by some new tuple, that tuple would be seen as part of the pre-existing HOT chain, creating a form of index corruption. If this has happened, reindexing the table should repair the damage. However, this is an extremely low-probability scenario, so we do not recommend reindexing just on the chance that it might have happened.",

Presumably, once 3.12 is out, `configure --with-python` would fail altogether.

If any operations had been done on such an index without first upgrading the `ltree` extension to version 1.2, they were done assuming that the signature length was 28 bytes rather than the intended 8. This means it is very likely that such indexes are now corrupt. For safety we recommend re-indexing all GiST indexes on ltree columns after installing this update.

We'd previously attempted to make them track any column aliases that had been applied to the `FROM` entry the variable refers to. But that's semantically dubious, because really then the output of the variable is not at all of the composite type it claims to be. Previous attempts to deal with that inconsistency had bad results up to and including storing unreadable data on disk, so just give up on the whole idea.\n          In cases where it's important to be able to relabel such columns, a workaround is to introduce an extra level of sub-`SELECT`, so that the whole-row variable is referring to the sub-`SELECT`'s output and not to a plain table. Then the variable is of type record to begin with and there's no issue.",

Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n          These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n          It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

      "other": [
        "Fix failure to remove non-first segments of large tables (Tom Lane)\n          PostgreSQL splits large tables into multiple files (normally with 1GB per file). The logic for dropping a table was broken and would miss removing all but the first such file, in two cases: drops of temporary tables and WAL replay of drops of regular tables. Applications that routinely create multi-gigabyte temporary tables could suffer significant disk space leakage.\n          Orphaned temporary-table files are removed during postmaster start, so the mere act of updating to 15.1 is sufficient to clear any leaked temporary-table storage. However, if you suffered any database crashes while using 15.0, and there might have been large tables dropped just before such crashes, it's advisable to check the database directories for files named according to the pattern ``NNNN`.NN`. If there is no matching file named just ``NNNN`` (without the `.`NN`` suffix), these files should be removed manually.",
        "Fix handling of `DEFAULT` tokens that appear in a multi-row `VALUES` clause of an INSERT on an updatable view (Tom Lane)\n          This oversight could lead to “cache lookup failed for type” errors, or in older branches even to crashes.",
        "Disallow rules named `_RETURN` that are not `ON SELECT` (Tom Lane)\n          This avoids confusion between a view's `ON SELECT` rule and any other rules it may have.",
        "Avoid failure in EXPLAIN VERBOSE for a query using `SEARCH BREADTH FIRST` with constant initial values (Tom Lane)",
        "Prevent use of MERGE on a partitioned table with foreign-table partitions (Álvaro Herrera)\n          The case isn't supported, and previously threw an incomprehensible error.",
        "Fix planner failure with extended statistics on partitioned or inherited tables (Richard Guo, Justin Pryzby)\n          Some cases failed with “cache lookup failed for statistics object”.",
        "Fix mis-ordering of WAL operations in fast insert path for GIN indexes (Matthias van de Meent, Zhang Mingli)\n          This mistake is not known to have any negative consequences within core PostgreSQL, but it did cause issues for some extensions.",
        "Fix bugs in logical decoding when replay starts from a point between the beginning of a transaction and the beginning of its subtransaction (Masahiko Sawada, Kuroda Hayato)\n          These errors could lead to assertion failures in debug builds, and otherwise to memory leaks.",
        "Accept interrupts in more places during logical decoding (Amit Kapila, Masahiko Sawada)\n          This ameliorates problems with slow shutdown of replication workers.",
        "Prevent attempts to replicate into a foreign-table partition in replication workers (Shi Yu, Tom Lane)\n          Although partitioned tables can have foreign tables as partitions, replicating into such a partition isn't currently supported. The logical replication worker process would crash if it was attempted. Now, an error is thrown.",
        "Avoid crash after function syntax error in replication workers (Maxim Orlov, Anton Melnikov, Masahiko Sawada, Tom Lane)\n          If a syntax error occurred in a SQL-language or PL/pgSQL-language CREATE FUNCTION or DO command executed in a logical replication worker, the worker process would crash with a null pointer dereference or assertion failure.",
        "Avoid double call of the shutdown callback of an archiver module (Nathan Bossart, Bharath Rupireddy)",
        "Add plan-time check for attempted access to a table that has no table access method (Tom Lane)\n          This prevents a crash in some catalog-corruption scenarios, for example use of a view whose `ON SELECT` rule is missing.",
        "Prevent postmaster crash when shared-memory state is corrupted (Tom Lane)\n          The postmaster process is supposed to survive and initiate a database restart if shared memory becomes corrupted, but one bit of code was being insufficiently cautious about that.",
        "In libpq, handle single-row mode correctly when pipelining (Denis Laxalde)\n          The single-row flag was not reset at the correct time if pipeline mode was also active.",
        "Fix psql's exit status when a command-line query is canceled (Peter Eisentraut)\n          `psql -c `query`` would exit successfully if the query was canceled. Fix it to exit with nonzero status, as in other error cases.",
        "Allow cross-platform tablespace relocation in pg_basebackup (Robert Haas)\n          Allow the remote path in --tablespace-mapping to be either a Unix-style or Windows-style absolute path, since the source server could be on a different OS than the local system.",
        "Fix pg_dump's failure to dump comments attached to some `CHECK` constraints (Tom Lane)",
        "Fix CREATE DATABASE to allow its `oid` parameter to exceed 231 (Tom Lane)\n          This oversight prevented pg_upgrade from succeeding when the source installation contained databases with OIDs larger than that.",
        "In pg_stat_statements, fix access to already-freed memory (zhaoqigui)\n          This occurred if pg_stat_statements tracked a ROLLBACK command issued via extended query protocol. In debug builds it consistently led to an assertion failure. In production builds there would often be no visible ill effect; but if the freed memory had already been reused, the likely result would be to store garbage for the query string.",
        "Fix incompatibilities with LLVM 15 (Thomas Munro, Andres Freund)",
        "Allow use of `__sync_lock_test_and_set()()` for spinlocks on any machine (Tom Lane)\n          This eases porting to new machine architectures, at least if you're using a compiler that supports this GCC builtin function.",
        "Rename symbol `REF` to `REF_P` to avoid compile failure on recent macOS (Tom Lane)",
        "Avoid using `sprintf()`, to avoid compile-time deprecation warnings (Tom Lane)",
        "Update time zone data files to tzdata release 2022f for DST law changes in Chile, Fiji, Iran, Jordan, Mexico, Palestine, and Syria, plus historical corrections for Chile, Crimea, Iran, and Mexico.\n          Also, the Europe/Kiev zone has been renamed to Europe/Kyiv. Also, the following zones have been merged into nearby, more-populous zones whose clocks have agreed with them since 1970: Antarctica/Vostok, Asia/Brunei, Asia/Kuala_Lumpur, Atlantic/Reykjavik, Europe/Amsterdam, Europe/Copenhagen, Europe/Luxembourg, Europe/Monaco, Europe/Oslo, Europe/Stockholm, Indian/Christmas, Indian/Cocos, Indian/Kerguelen, Indian/Mahe, Indian/Reunion, Pacific/Chuuk, Pacific/Funafuti, Pacific/Majuro, Pacific/Pohnpei, Pacific/Wake and Pacific/Wallis. (This indirectly affects zones that were already links to one of these: Arctic/Longyearbyen, Atlantic/Jan_Mayen, Iceland, Pacific/Ponape, Pacific/Truk, and Pacific/Yap.) America/Nipigon, America/Rainy_River, America/Thunder_Bay, Europe/Uzhgorod, and Europe/Zaporozhye were also merged into nearby zones after discovering that their claimed post-1970 differences from those zones seem to have been errors. In all these cases, the previous zone name remains as an alias; but the actual data is that of the zone that was merged into.\n          These zone mergers result in loss of pre-1970 timezone history for the merged zones, which may be troublesome for applications expecting consistency of timestamptz display. As an example, the stored value `1944-06-01 12:00 UTC` would previously display as `1944-06-01 13:00:00+01` if the Europe/Stockholm zone is selected, but now it will read out as `1944-06-01 14:00:00+02`.\n          It is possible to build the time zone data files with options that will restore the older zone data, but that choice also inserts a lot of other old (and typically poorly-attested) zone data, resulting in more total changes from the previous release than accepting these upstream changes does. PostgreSQL has chosen to ship the tzdb data as-recommended, and so far as we are aware most major operating system distributions are doing likewise. However, if these changes cause significant problems for your application, a possible solution is to install a local build of the time zone data files using tzdb's backwards-compatibility options (see their `PACKRATDATA` and `PACKRATLIST` options)."

        "Fix possible dangling-pointer access during execution of window function run-condition expressions (David Rowley)\n          In practice, because the run-condition optimization is only applied to certain window functions that happen to all return int8, this only manifested as a problem on 32-bit builds.",
        "Limit the amount of cleanup work done by `get_actual_variable_range()` (Simon Riggs)\n          Planner runs occurring just after deletion of a large number of tuples appearing at the end of an index could expend significant amounts of work setting the “killed” bits for those index entries. Limit the amount of work done in any one query by giving up on this process after examining 100 heap pages. All the cleanup will still happen eventually, but without so large a performance hiccup.",

        "libpq can leak memory contents after GSSAPI transport encryption initiation fails (Jacob Champion)\n          A modified server, or an unauthenticated man-in-the-middle, can send a not-zero-terminated error message during setup of GSSAPI (Kerberos) transport encryption. libpq will then copy that string, as well as following bytes in application memory up to the next zero byte, to its error report. Depending on what the calling application does with the error report, this could result in disclosure of application memory contents. There is also a small probability of a crash due to reading beyond the end of memory. Fix by properly zero-terminating the server message. (CVE-2022-41862)",
        "Fix calculation of which `GENERATED` columns need to be updated in child tables during an UPDATE on a partitioned table or inheritance tree (Amit Langote, Tom Lane)\n          This fixes failure to update `GENERATED` columns that do not exist in the parent table, or that have different dependencies than are in the parent column's generation expression.",
        "Fix possible failure of MERGE to compute `GENERATED` columns (Dean Rasheed)\n          When the first row-level action of the MERGE was an `UPDATE`, any subsequent `INSERT` actions would fail to compute `GENERATED` columns that were deemed unnecessary to compute for the `UPDATE` action (due to not depending on any of the `UPDATE` target columns).",
        "Fix MERGE's check for unreachable `WHEN` clauses (Dean Rasheed)\n          A `WHEN` clause following an unconditional `WHEN` clause should be rejected as unreachable, but this case was not always detected.",
        "Fix MERGE's rule-detection test (Dean Rasheed)\n          MERGE is not supported on tables with rules; but it also failed on tables that once had rules but no longer do.",

        "Allow `REPLICA IDENTITY` to be set on an index that's not (yet) valid (Tom Lane)\n          When pg_dump dumps a partitioned index that's marked `REPLICA IDENTITY`, it generates a command sequence that applies `REPLICA IDENTITY` before the partitioned index has been marked valid, causing restore to fail. There seems no very good reason to prohibit doing it in that order, so allow it. The marking will have no effect anyway until the index becomes valid.",
        "Fix handling of `DEFAULT` markers in rules that perform an INSERT from a multi-row `VALUES` list (Dean Rasheed)\n          In some cases a `DEFAULT` marker would not get replaced with the proper default-value expression, leading to an “unrecognized node type” error.",
        "Reject uses of undefined variables in jsonpath existence checks (Alexander Korotkov, David G. Johnston)\n          While jsonpath match operators threw an error for an undefined variable in the path pattern, the existence operators silently treated it as a match.",
        "Fix jsonb subscripting to cope with toasted subscript values (Tom Lane, David G. Johnston)\n          Using a text value fetched directly from a table as a jsonb subscript was likely to fail. Fetches would usually not find any matching element. Assignments could store the value with a garbage key, although keys long enough to cause that problem are probably rare in the field.",
        "Fix edge-case data corruption in parallel hash joins (Dmitry Astapov)\n          If the final chunk of a large tuple being written out to a temporary file was exactly 32760 bytes, it would be corrupted due to a fencepost bug. The query would typically fail later with corrupted-data symptoms.",

Most places got this right already, but some recently-written replication logic did not.",
        "Remove arbitrary limit on number of elements in int2vector and oidvector (Tom Lane)\n          The input functions for these types previously rejected more than 100 elements. With the introduction of the logical replication column list feature, it's necessary to accept int2vectors having up to 1600 columns, otherwise long column lists cause logical-replication failures.",

        "Reject cancel request packets having the wrong length (Andrey Borodin)\n          The server would process a cancel request even if its length word was too small. This led to reading beyond the end of the allocated buffer. In theory that could cause a segfault, but it seems quite unlikely to happen in practice, since the buffer would have to be very close to the end of memory. The more likely outcome was a bogus log message about wrong backend PID or cancel code. Complain about the wrong length, instead.",

        "Add recursion and looping defenses in subquery pullup (Tom Lane)\n          A contrived query can result in deep recursion and unreasonable amounts of time spent trying to flatten subqueries. A proper fix for that seems unduly invasive for a back-patch, but we can at least add stack depth checks and an interrupt check to allow the query to be cancelled.",

In version 15 that could lead to an undetected deadlock. In version 14, no deadlock has been observed, but it's still a bad idea to block interrupts while waiting for network I/O.",
        "Clean up the libpq connection object after a failed replication connection attempt (Andres Freund)\n          The previous coding leaked the connection object. In background code paths that's pretty harmless because the calling process will give up and exit. But in commands such as CREATE SUBSCRIPTION, such a failure resulted in a small session-lifespan memory leak.",
        "Ignore invalidated logical-replication slots while determining oldest catalog xmin (Sirisha Chamarthi)\n          A replication slot could prevent cleanup of dead tuples in the system catalogs even after it becomes invalidated due to exceeding max_slot_wal_keep_size. Thus, failure of a replication consumer could lead to indefinitely-large catalog bloat.",
        "In logical decoding, notify the remote node when a transaction is detected to have crashed (Hou Zhijie)\n          After a server restart, we'll re-stream the changes for transactions occurring shortly before the restart. Some of these transactions probably never completed; when we realize that one didn't we throw away the relevant decoding state locally, but we neglected to tell the subscriber about it. That led to the subscriber keeping useless streaming files until it's next restarted.",

This did not cause a problem when the receiver is our built-in logical replication code, but it might confuse other receivers, and in any case it wasted network bandwidth.",

        "Fix `int64_div_fast_to_numeric()()` to work for a wider range of inputs (Dean Rasheed)\n          This function misbehaved with some values of its second argument. No such usages exist in core PostgreSQL, but it's clearly a hazard for external modules, so repair.",
        "Fix latent buffer-overrun problem in `WaitEventSet` logic (Thomas Munro)\n          The `epoll()`-based and `kqueue()`-based implementations could ask the kernel for too many events if the size of their internal buffer was different from the size of the caller's output buffer. That case is not known to occur in released PostgreSQL versions, but this error is a hazard for external modules and future bug fixes.",
        "Avoid nominally-undefined behavior when accessing shared memory in 32-bit builds (Andres Freund)\n          clang's undefined-behavior sanitizer complained about use of a pointer that was less aligned than it should be.

However, `GMT` is recognized by hard-wired code in the server, while `UTC` is looked up in the timezone database. So the old code could fail in the unlikely event that the remote server's timezone database is missing entries.",

        "Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump (Masahiko Sawada)\n          An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg_dump session with the privileges of the role running pg_dump (which is often a superuser). The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will execute malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server parameter restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind that can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and teach pg_dump to set it when available. Note that the attack is prevented only if both pg_dump and the server it is dumping from are new enough to have this fix.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem. (CVE-2024-7348)",
        "Prevent infinite loop in VACUUM (Melanie Plageman)\n          After a disconnected standby server with an old running transaction reconnected to the primary, it was possible for VACUUM on the primary to get confused about which tuples are removable, resulting in an infinite loop.",
        "Fix failure after attaching a table as a partition, if the table had previously had inheritance children (Álvaro Herrera)",
        "Fix ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION for cases involving inconsistent index-based constraints (Álvaro Herrera, Tender Wang)\n          When a partitioned table has an index that is not associated with a constraint, but a partition has an equivalent index that is, then detaching the partition would misbehave, leaving the ex-partition's constraint with an incorrect coninhcount value. This would cause trouble during any further manipulations of that constraint.",
        "Fix partition pruning setup during `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` (Álvaro Herrera)\n          The executor assumed that no partition could be detached between planning and execution of a query on a partitioned table. This is no longer true since the introduction of `DETACH PARTITION`'s `CONCURRENTLY` option, making it possible for query execution to fail transiently when that is used.",
        "Correctly update a partitioned table's pg_class.reltuples field to zero after its last child partition is dropped (Noah Misch)\n          The first ANALYZE on such a partitioned table must update relhassubclass as well, and that caused the reltuples update to be lost.",
        "Fix handling of polymorphic output arguments for procedures (Tom Lane)\n          The SQL CALL statement did not resolve the correct data types for such arguments, leading to errors such as “cannot display a value of type anyelement”, or even outright crashes. (But CALL in PL/pgSQL worked correctly.)",
        "Fix behavior of stable functions called from a CALL statement's argument list (Tom Lane)\n          If the CALL is within an atomic context (e.g. there's an outer transaction block), such functions were passed the wrong snapshot, causing them to see stale values of rows modified since the start of the outer transaction.",
        "Detect integer overflow in money calculations (Joseph Koshakow)\n          None of the arithmetic functions for the money type checked for overflow before, so they would silently give wrong answers for overflowing cases.",
        "Fix over-aggressive clamping of the scale argument in `round(numeric)()` and `trunc(numeric)()` (Dean Rasheed)\n          These functions clamped their scale argument to +/-2000, but there are valid use-cases for it to be larger; the functions returned incorrect results in such cases. Instead clamp to the actual allowed range of type numeric.",
        "Fix result for `pg_size_pretty()()` when applied to the smallest possible bigint value (Joseph Koshakow)",
        "Prevent `pg_sequence_last_value()()` from failing on unlogged sequences on standby servers and on temporary sequences of other sessions (Nathan Bossart)\n          Make it return NULL in these cases instead of throwing an error.",
        "Fix parsing of ignored operators in `websearch_to_tsquery()()` (Tom Lane)\n          Per the manual, punctuation in the input of `websearch_to_tsquery()()` is ignored except for the special cases of dashes and quotes. However, parentheses and a few other characters appearing immediately before an `or` could cause `or` to be treated as a data word, rather than as an `OR` operator as expected.",
        "Detect another integer overflow case while computing new array dimensions (Joseph Koshakow)\n          Reject applying array dimensions `[-2147483648:2147483647]` to an empty array. This is closely related to CVE-2023-5869, but appears harmless since the array still ends up empty.",
        "Detect another case of a new catalog cache entry becoming stale while detoasting its fields (Noah Misch)\n          An in-place update occurring while we expand out-of-line fields in a catalog tuple could be missed, leading to a catalog cache entry that lacks the in-place change but is not known to be stale. This is only possible in the pg_database catalog, so the effects are narrow, but misbehavior is possible.",
        "Correctly check updatability of view columns targeted by `INSERT` ... `DEFAULT` (Tom Lane)\n          If such a column is non-updatable, we should give an error reporting that. But the check was missed and then later code would report an unhelpful error such as “attribute number `N` not found in view targetlist”.",
        "Avoid reporting an unhelpful internal error for incorrect recursive queries (Tom Lane)\n          Rearrange the order of error checks so that we throw an on-point error when a WITH RECURSIVE query does not have a self-reference within the second arm of the `UNION`, but does have one self-reference in some other place such as `ORDER BY`.",
        "Lock owned sequences during `ALTER TABLE SET LOGGED|UNLOGGED` (Noah Misch)\n          These commands change the persistence of a table's owned sequences along with the table, but they failed to acquire lock on the sequences while doing so. This could result in losing the effects of concurrent `nextval()()` calls.",
        "Don't throw an error if a queued `AFTER` trigger no longer exists (Tom Lane)\n          It's possible for a transaction to execute an operation that queues a deferred `AFTER` trigger for later execution, and then to drop the trigger before that happens. Formerly this led to weird errors such as “could not find trigger `NNNN`”. It seems better to silently do nothing if the trigger no longer exists at the time when it would have been executed.",
        "Fix failure to remove pg_init_privs entries for column-level privileges when their table is dropped (Tom Lane)\n          If an extension grants some column-level privileges on a table it creates, relevant catalog entries would remain behind after the extension is dropped. This was harmless until/unless the table's OID was re-used for another relation, when it could interfere with what pg_dump dumps for that relation.",
        "Fix selection of an arbiter index for `ON CONFLICT` when the desired index has expressions or predicates (Tom Lane)\n          If a query using `ON CONFLICT` accesses the target table through an updatable view, it could fail with “there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification”, even though a matching index does exist.",
        "Refuse to modify a temporary table of another session with `ALTER TABLE` (Tom Lane)\n          Permissions checks normally would prevent this case from arising, but it is possible to reach it by altering a parent table whose child is another session's temporary table. Throw an error if we discover that such a child table belongs to another session.",
        "Fix handling of extended statistics on expressions in `CREATE TABLE LIKE STATISTICS` (Tom Lane)\n          The `CREATE` command failed to adjust column references in statistics expressions to the possibly-different column numbering of the new table. This resulted in invalid statistics objects that would cause problems later. A typical scenario where renumbering columns is needed is when the source table contains some dropped columns.",
        "Fix failure to recalculate sub-queries generated from `MIN()()` or `MAX()()` aggregates (Tom Lane)\n          In some cases the aggregate result computed at one row of the outer query could be re-used for later rows when it should not be. This has only been seen to happen when the outer query uses `DISTINCT` that is implemented with hash aggregation, but other cases may exist.",
        "Avoid crashing when a JIT-inlined backend function throws an error (Tom Lane)\n          The error state can include pointers into the dynamically loaded module holding the JIT-compiled code (for error location strings). In some code paths the module could get unloaded before the error report is processed, leading to SIGSEGV when the location strings are accessed.",
        "Cope with behavioral changes in libxml2 version 2.13.x (Erik Wienhold, Tom Lane)\n          Notably, we now suppress “chunk is not well balanced” errors from libxml2, unless that is the only reported error. This is to make error reports consistent between 2.13.x and earlier libxml2 versions. In earlier versions, that message was almost always redundant or outright incorrect, so 2.13.x substantially reduced the number of cases in which it's reported.",
        "Fix handling of subtransactions of prepared transactions when starting a hot standby server (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          When starting a standby's replay at a shutdown checkpoint WAL record, transactions that had been prepared but not yet committed on the primary are correctly understood as being still in progress. But subtransactions of a prepared transaction (created by savepoints or PL/pgSQL exception blocks) were not accounted for and would be treated as aborted. That led to inconsistency if the prepared transaction was later committed.",
        "Prevent incorrect initialization of logical replication slots (Masahiko Sawada)\n          In some cases a replication slot's start point within the WAL stream could be set to a point within a transaction, leading to assertion failures or incorrect decoding results.",
        "Avoid “can only drop stats once” error during replication slot creation and drop (Floris Van Nee)",
        "Fix resource leakage in logical replication WAL sender (Hou Zhijie)\n          The walsender process leaked memory when publishing changes to a partitioned table whose partitions have row types physically different from the partitioned table's.",
        "Avoid memory leakage after servicing a notify or sinval interrupt (Tom Lane)\n          The processing functions for these events could switch the current memory context to TopMemoryContext, resulting in session-lifespan leakage of any data allocated before the incorrect setting gets replaced. There were observable leaks associated with (at least) encoding conversion of incoming queries and parameters attached to Bind messages.",
        "Prevent leakage of reference counts for the shared memory block used for statistics (Anthonin Bonnefoy)\n          A new backend process attaching to the statistics shared memory incremented its reference count, but failed to decrement the count when exiting. After 232 sessions had been created, the reference count would overflow to zero, causing failures in all subsequent backend process starts.",
        "Prevent deadlocks and assertion failures during truncation of the multixact SLRU log (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          A process trying to delete SLRU segments could deadlock with the checkpointer process.",
        "Avoid possibly missing end-of-input events on Windows sockets (Thomas Munro)\n          Windows reports an FD_CLOSE event only once after the remote end of the connection disconnects. With unlucky timing, we could miss that report and wait indefinitely, or at least until a timeout elapsed, expecting more input.",
        "Fix buffer overread in JSON parse error reports for incomplete byte sequences (Jacob Champion)\n          It was possible to walk off the end of the input buffer by a few bytes when the last bytes comprise an incomplete multi-byte character. While usually harmless, in principle this could cause a crash.",
        "Disable creation of stateful TLS session tickets by OpenSSL (Daniel Gustafsson)\n          This avoids possible failures with clients that think receipt of a session ticket means that TLS session resumption is supported.",
        "When replanning a PL/pgSQL “simple expression”, check it's still simple (Tom Lane)\n          Certain fairly-artificial cases, such as dropping a referenced function and recreating it as an aggregate, could lead to surprising failures such as “unexpected plan node type”.",
        "Fix incompatibility between PL/Perl and Perl 5.40 (Andrew Dunstan)",
        "Fix recursive RECORD-returning PL/Python functions (Tom Lane)\n          If we recurse to a new call of the same function that passes a different column definition list (`AS` clause), it would fail because the inner call would overwrite the outer call's idea of what rowtype to return.",
        "Don't corrupt PL/Python's `TD` dictionary during a recursive trigger call (Tom Lane)\n          If a PL/Python-language trigger caused another one to be invoked, the `TD` dictionary created for the inner one would overwrite the outer one's `TD` dictionary.",
        "Fix PL/Tcl's reporting of invalid list syntax in the result of a function returning tuple (Erik Wienhold, Tom Lane)\n          Such a case could result in a crash, or in emission of misleading context information that actually refers to the previous Tcl error.",
        "Avoid non-thread-safe usage of `strerror()()` in libpq (Peter Eisentraut)\n          Certain error messages returned by OpenSSL could become garbled in multi-threaded applications.",
        "Avoid memory leak within pg_dump during a binary upgrade (Daniel Gustafsson)",
        "Ensure that `pg_restore` -l reports dependent TOC entries correctly (Tom Lane)\n          If -l was specified together with selective-restore options such as -n or -N, dependent TOC entries such as comments would be omitted from the listing, even when an actual restore would have selected them.",
        "Avoid “cursor can only scan forward” error in contrib/postgres_fdw (Etsuro Fujita)\n          This error could occur if the remote server is v15 or later and a foreign table is mapped to a non-trivial remote view.",
        "In contrib/postgres_fdw, do not send `FETCH FIRST WITH TIES` clauses to the remote server (Japin Li)\n          The remote server might not implement this clause, or might interpret it differently than we would locally, so don't risk attempting remote execution.",

It was able to signal these background processes, though, because they advertise a role OID of zero. Treat that as indicating superuser ownership. The security implications of cancelling one of these process types are fairly small so far as the core code goes (we'll just start another one), but extensions might add background workers that are more vulnerable.\n          Also ensure that the is_superuser parameter is set correctly in such processes.

This breaks assumptions made by btree de-duplication, so interval columns need to be excluded from de-duplication. This oversight can cause incorrect results from index-only scans.

This would lead to firing statement-level triggers associated with that table, rather than the initially-named table as should happen. In v16, the same oversight could also lead to “invalid perminfoindex 0 in RTE with relid NNNN” errors.",

View columns such as most_common_vals might expose security-relevant data. The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated table.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem. (CVE-2024-4317)\n          By itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd database clusters. If you wish to apply this change in an existing cluster, you will need to do the following:\n          \n            \n              \n                Find the SQL script fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql in the `share` directory of the PostgreSQL installation (typically located someplace like /usr/share/postgresql/). Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only v14–v16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.\n              \n              \n                In each database of the cluster, run the fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql script as superuser. In psql this would look like\n                \\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql\n\n                (adjust the file path as appropriate). Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script version. It will not hurt to run the script more than once.\n              \n              \n                Do not forget to include the `template0` and `template1` databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later.

        "Require `SELECT` privilege on the target table for MERGE with a `DO NOTHING` clause (Álvaro Herrera)\n          `SELECT` privilege would be required in all practical cases anyway, but require it even if the query reads no columns of the target table. This avoids an edge case in which MERGE would require no privileges whatever, which seems undesirable even when it's a do-nothing command.",

(The previous coding could silently ignore this condition if a concurrent update was involved.) Also, throw a non-misleading error if a target row is already updated by a later command in the current transaction, thanks to a `BEFORE` trigger or a volatile function used in the query.",
        "Fix incorrect pruning of NULL partition when a table is partitioned on a boolean column and the query has a boolean `IS NOT` clause (David Rowley)\n          A NULL value satisfies a clause such as ``boolcol` IS NOT FALSE`, so pruning away a partition containing NULLs yielded incorrect answers.",
        "Make ALTER FOREIGN TABLE SET SCHEMA move any owned sequences into the new schema (Tom Lane)\n          Moving a regular table to a new schema causes any sequences owned by the table to be moved to that schema too (along with indexes and constraints).

However, an incoming session that's been assigned the same temporary namespace will do that too. If a temporary table has a dependency (such as an owned sequence) then a deadlock could result between these two cleanup attempts.",
        "Fix updating of visibility map state in VACUUM with the `DISABLE_PAGE_SKIPPING` option (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          Due to an oversight, this mode caused all heap pages to be dirtied, resulting in excess I/O. Also, visibility map bits that were incorrectly set would not get cleared.",

All versions have a similar hazard when considering joins to UNION ALL trees that have constant outputs for the join column in some SELECT arms.",

If the actual function output value doesn't match that, an error is supposed to be thrown at runtime. However, some code paths would examine the actual value prematurely, and potentially issue strange errors or suffer assertion failures if it doesn't match expectations.",

        "Fix mis-rounding and overflow hazards in `date_bin()()` (Moaaz Assali)\n          In the case where the source timestamp is before the origin timestamp and their difference is already an exact multiple of the stride, the code incorrectly subtracted the stride anyway. Also, detect some integer-overflow cases that would have produced incorrect results.",

        "Fix detection of old transaction IDs in XID status functions (Karina Litskevich)\n          Transaction IDs more than 231 transactions in the past could be misidentified as recent, leading to misbehavior of `pg_xact_status()()` or `txid_status()()`.",
        "Ensure that a table's freespace map won't return a page that's past the end of the table (Ronan Dunklau)\n          Because the freespace map isn't WAL-logged, this was possible in edge cases involving an OS crash, a replica promote, or a PITR restore.

        "Disconnect if a new server session's client socket cannot be put into non-blocking mode (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          It was once theoretically possible for us to operate with a socket that's in blocking mode; but that hasn't worked fully in a long time, so fail at connection start rather than misbehave later.",
        "Fix inadequate error reporting with OpenSSL 3.0.0 and later (Heikki Linnakangas, Tom Lane)\n          System-reported errors passed through by OpenSSL were reported with a numeric error code rather than anything readable.",
        "Fix thread-safety of error reporting for `getaddrinfo()()` on Windows (Thomas Munro)\n          A multi-threaded libpq client program could get an incorrect or corrupted error message after a network lookup failure.",

        "Skip files named .DS_Store in pg_basebackup, pg_checksums, and pg_rewind (Daniel Gustafsson)\n          This avoids problems on macOS, where the Finder may create such files.",
        "Fix PL/pgSQL's parsing of single-line comments (`--`-style comments) following expressions (Erik Wienhold, Tom Lane)\n          This mistake caused parse errors if such a comment followed a `WHEN` expression in a PL/pgSQL CASE statement.",
        "In contrib/amcheck, don't report false match failures due to short- versus long-header values (Andrey Borodin, Michael Zhilin)\n          A variable-length datum in a heap tuple or index tuple could have either a short or a long header, depending on compression parameters that applied when it was made. Treat these cases as equivalent rather than complaining if there's a difference.",
        "Fix bugs in BRIN output functions (Tomas Vondra)\n          These output functions are only used for displaying index entries in contrib/pageinspect, so the errors are of limited practical concern.",
        "In contrib/postgres_fdw, avoid emitting requests to sort by a constant (David Rowley)\n          This could occur in cases involving `UNION ALL` with constant-emitting subqueries.

        "Prevent unauthorized code execution during pg_dump (Masahiko Sawada)\n          An attacker able to create and drop non-temporary objects could inject SQL code that would be executed by a concurrent pg_dump session with the privileges of the role running pg_dump (which is often a superuser). The attack involves replacing a sequence or similar object with a view or foreign table that will execute malicious code. To prevent this, introduce a new server parameter restrict_nonsystem_relation_kind that can disable expansion of non-builtin views as well as access to foreign tables, and teach pg_dump to set it when available. Note that the attack is prevented only if both pg_dump and the server it is dumping from are new enough to have this fix.\n          The PostgreSQL Project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

This would cause trouble during any further manipulations of that constraint.",
        "Fix partition pruning setup during `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` (Álvaro Herrera)\n          The executor assumed that no partition could be detached between planning and execution of a query on a partitioned table. This is no longer true since the introduction of `DETACH PARTITION`'s `CONCURRENTLY` option, making it possible for query execution to fail transiently when that is used.",

Formerly this led to weird errors such as “could not find trigger `NNNN`”. It seems better to silently do nothing if the trigger no longer exists at the time when it would have been executed.",
        "Fix failure to remove pg_init_privs entries for column-level privileges when their table is dropped (Tom Lane)\n          If an extension grants some column-level privileges on a table it creates, relevant catalog entries would remain behind after the extension is dropped.

It seems better to revert to the original definition in which a parameter symbol is only `$` followed by digits.",
        "Avoid crashing when a JIT-inlined backend function throws an error (Tom Lane)\n          The error state can include pointers into the dynamically loaded module holding the JIT-compiled code (for error location strings). In some code paths the module could get unloaded before the error report is processed, leading to SIGSEGV when the location strings are accessed.",
        "Cope with behavioral changes in libxml2 version 2.13.x (Erik Wienhold, Tom Lane)\n          Notably, we now suppress “chunk is not well balanced” errors from libxml2, unless that is the only reported error. This is to make error reports consistent between 2.13.x and earlier libxml2 versions. In earlier versions, that message was almost always redundant or outright incorrect, so 2.13.x substantially reduced the number of cases in which it's reported.",
        "Fix handling of subtransactions of prepared transactions when starting a hot standby server (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          When starting a standby's replay at a shutdown checkpoint WAL record, transactions that had been prepared but not yet committed on the primary are correctly understood as being still in progress. But subtransactions of a prepared transaction (created by savepoints or PL/pgSQL exception blocks) were not accounted for and would be treated as aborted. That led to inconsistency if the prepared transaction was later committed.",
        "Prevent incorrect initialization of logical replication slots (Masahiko Sawada)\n          In some cases a replication slot's start point within the WAL stream could be set to a point within a transaction, leading to assertion failures or incorrect decoding results.",
        "Avoid “can only drop stats once” error during replication slot creation and drop (Floris Van Nee)",
        "Fix resource leakage in logical replication WAL sender (Hou Zhijie)\n          The walsender process leaked memory when publishing changes to a partitioned table whose partitions have row types physically different from the partitioned table's.",
        "Avoid memory leakage after servicing a notify or sinval interrupt (Tom Lane)\n          The processing functions for these events could switch the current memory context to TopMemoryContext, resulting in session-lifespan leakage of any data allocated before the incorrect setting gets replaced. There were observable leaks associated with (at least) encoding conversion of incoming queries and parameters attached to Bind messages.",
        "Prevent leakage of reference counts for the shared memory block used for statistics (Anthonin Bonnefoy)\n          A new backend process attaching to the statistics shared memory incremented its reference count, but failed to decrement the count when exiting. After 232 sessions had been created, the reference count would overflow to zero, causing failures in all subsequent backend process starts.",
        "Prevent deadlocks and assertion failures during truncation of the multixact SLRU log (Heikki Linnakangas)\n          A process trying to delete SLRU segments could deadlock with the checkpointer process.",
        "Avoid possibly missing end-of-input events on Windows sockets (Thomas Munro)\n          Windows reports an FD_CLOSE event only once after the remote end of the connection disconnects. With unlucky timing, we could miss that report and wait indefinitely, or at least until a timeout elapsed, expecting more input.",
        "Fix buffer overread in JSON parse error reports for incomplete byte sequences (Jacob Champion)\n          It was possible to walk off the end of the input buffer by a few bytes when the last bytes comprise an incomplete multi-byte character. While usually harmless, in principle this could cause a crash.",
        "Disable creation of stateful TLS session tickets by OpenSSL (Daniel Gustafsson)\n          This avoids possible failures with clients that think receipt of a session ticket means that TLS session resumption is supported.",
        "When replanning a PL/pgSQL “simple expression”, check it's still simple (Tom Lane)\n          Certain fairly-artificial cases, such as dropping a referenced function and recreating it as an aggregate, could lead to surprising failures such as “unexpected plan node type”.",
        "Fix PL/pgSQL's handling of integer ranges containing underscores (Erik Wienhold)\n          As of v16 we allow integer literals to contain underscores, but PL/pgSQL failed to handle examples such as `FOR i IN 1_001..1_003`.",
        "Fix recursive RECORD-returning PL/Python functions (Tom Lane)\n          If we recurse to a new call of the same function that passes a different column definition list (`AS` clause), it would fail because the inner call would overwrite the outer call's idea of what rowtype to return.",
        "Don't corrupt PL/Python's `TD` dictionary during a recursive trigger call (Tom Lane)\n          If a PL/Python-language trigger caused another one to be invoked, the `TD` dictionary created for the inner one would overwrite the outer one's `TD` dictionary.",
        "Fix PL/Tcl's reporting of invalid list syntax in the result of a function returning tuple (Erik Wienhold, Tom Lane)\n          Such a case could result in a crash, or in emission of misleading context information that actually refers to the previous Tcl error.",
        "Avoid non-thread-safe usage of `strerror()()` in libpq (Peter Eisentraut)\n          Certain error messages returned by OpenSSL could become garbled in multi-threaded applications.",
        "Avoid memory leak within pg_dump during a binary upgrade (Daniel Gustafsson)",
        "Ensure that `pg_restore` -l reports dependent TOC entries correctly (Tom Lane)\n          If -l was specified together with selective-restore options such as -n or -N, dependent TOC entries such as comments would be omitted from the listing, even when an actual restore would have selected them.",
        "Allow contrib/pg_stat_statements to distinguish among utility statements appearing within SQL-language functions (Anthonin Bonnefoy)\n          The SQL-language function executor failed to pass along the query ID that is computed for a utility (non SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE) statement.",
        "Avoid “cursor can only scan forward” error in contrib/postgres_fdw (Etsuro Fujita)\n          This error could occur if the remote server is v15 or later and a foreign table is mapped to a non-trivial remote view.",
        "In contrib/postgres_fdw, do not send `FETCH FIRST WITH TIES` clauses to the remote server (Japin Li)\n          The remote server might not implement this clause, or might interpret it differently than we would locally, so don't risk attempting remote execution.",
